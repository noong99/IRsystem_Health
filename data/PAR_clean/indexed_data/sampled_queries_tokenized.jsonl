{"_id": "6114742-1", "title": "", "text": "A 71-year-old man with previously known keratoconus presented with bilateral cataract (Fig. ). In the left eye, PKP had been performed when the patient was 25 years old because of keratoconus (Fig. ). No surgery had been done in the right eye. Because of discomfort with contact lenses, the patient wore glasses both for near and far distance. The patient had a medical history of a transient ischemic attack and medicated with acetylsalicylic acid. The right eye presented with advanced keratoconus including Vogt striae (Fig. ) in the cornea and moderate senile nuclear cataract but no other pathology. The left eye presented with a clear corneal graft and moderate senile nuclear cataract but no other pathology. First surgery was only planned in the left eye. After more than 1.5 years surgery was also performed in the right eye. Written informed consent was acquired from the patient.\nPreoperatively, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40, with − 0.25 sph − 5.0 cyl 50°. The cornea exhibited regular astigmatism (K1 44.5 D, K2 48.5 D, astigmatism 3.9 D) (Fig. ) based on corneal tomography performed with Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam, Oculus, Germany). The toric IOL AcrySof IQ Toric SN6AT8 (Alcon, USA), 22 D was implanted with target refraction − 2.26 D. The target refraction was chosen to match the more myopic right eye. Biometry was performed with the IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) and Haigis formula was used. Preoperative marking of the toric IOL axis was performed with the patient in upright position to avoid misalignment due to cyclotorsion, using the RoboMarker (Surgilum, USA). Phacoemulsification and lens implantation were performed through a 2.2 mm limbal incision. One day postoperatively, BCVA was 20/40 with − 2.0 cyl 90°. Five weeks postoperatively BCVA was 20/30 with + 0.5 sph − 2.75 cyl 71°. Nine months postoperatively BCVA had improved to 20/25 with − 3.25 cyl 90° and the astigmatism was still regular (Fig. ) based on corneal tomography performed with Scheimpflug imaging. Two years postoperatively BCVA was still 20/25 with − 0.5 sph − 3.25 cyl 80°. The spherical equivalent 2 years postoperatively only differed − 0.135 D from the intended target refraction. During all postoperatively controls the toric IOL only misaligned 1° (from 139° to 140°) from the implanted axis and the corneal graft remained clear. The patient was very satisfied with the visual result from day one postoperatively.\nPreoperatively, BCVA was 20/150, with − 5.75 sph − 9.75 cyl 72° and the cornea had irregular astigmatism (K1 53 D, K2 57.7 D, astigmatism 4.7 D) (Fig. ) based on corneal tomography performed with Scheimpflug imaging. In the right eye, the astigmatism was judged as being too irregular for toric IOL implantation and cataract surgery was performed with the spherical IOL Acrysof Multipiece MN60MA (Alcon, USA), 5 D. Conventional biometry (IOLMaster) and Haigis formula was used to calculate the power of the spherical IOL. Two months postoperatively, BCVA was 20/80 with + 1.25 sph − 3 cyl 65°, spherical equivalent − 0.25. Target refraction prior to surgery was − 2.33 D, however the patient was pleased with the obtained result.

{"_id": "6390241-1", "title": "", "text": "A 24-year-old Caucasian male with a history that includes Addison's disease, developmental delay, hypogammaglobulinemia, PNH complicated by lower extremity thrombosis, minimal change disease (MCD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with headaches, fevers, and neck stiffness for several days after a tunneled dialysis catheter was placed for hemodialysis.\nThe patient was diagnosed with Addison's disease at the age of 14 years following a workup for ongoing fatigue. At that time, he was also found to have macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 9.3 G/dL, hematocrit 26.9 G/dL, and mean cell volume 114 FL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 16,000 U/L), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (1261 U/L), and reticulocytosis (3.6%). His direct antiglobulin test, platelet antibodies, and HIV antibodies were negative, and the ADAMTS13 activity level was normal. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was not suggestive of hemoglobinopathy. His peripheral blood smear reported anisopoikilocytosis, mild to moderate schistocytes, and Howell–Jolly bodies. Splenic ultrasound with Doppler studies were normal. Slightly increased osmotic fragility was present, and bone marrow biopsy reported a hypercellular marrow with predominance of erythroid precursors. Further evaluation including bone marrow biopsies, cytogenetic analysis, and autoimmune panels failed to confirm a cause for this patient's hemolytic anemia. After returning to the clinic with progressive fatigue and hematuria, the diagnosis of PNH was made when flow cytometry indicated PNH clonal populations in 38% of red blood cells (RBCs), 68% granulocytes, and 71% monocytes. Since the patient's anemia was transfusion independent and without evidence of thromboembolic disease, treatment with eculizumab was not offered until two years after the confirmed diagnosis which the patient refused. His renal function declined over time, and initial renal biopsies reported hemosiderosis due to PNH. His renal function continued to worsen over the next three years, and he eventually developed significant proteinuria (20 g/24 h) prompting repeat kidney biopsy. The results indicated significant hemosiderosis due to PNH as well as effacement of podocyte foot processes consistent with MCD. He was treated with prednisone and later rituximab for MCD. Rituximab was later discontinued after the patient developed new onset hypogammaglobulinemia after starting rituximab. His proteinuria resolved with continued steroid therapy, but his renal function did not improve, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. After the diagnosis of ESRD, the patient was agreeable to eculizumab and started therapy. The patient's clinical course was further complicated by recurrent catheter-associated infection.\nOver the past two years, the patient has been treated for frequent episodes of sepsis due to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, methicillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, Enterococcus faecalis meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and pneumonia. It was thought that the patient's recurrent infections were from poor tunneled dialysis catheter hygiene and maintenance.\nOn the current admission, peripheral blood smear demonstrated the presence of numerous Howell–Jolly bodies (), Pappenheimer bodies, acanthocytes, and target cells. Splenic sonogram now showed multifocal scarring and splenic atrophy, measuring 7.9 × 3.9 × 3.3 cm, suggestive of recurrent infarctions (). Liver-splenic scintigraphy with 99mTc-labelled colloid did not show splenic uptake, consistent with AS ().

{"_id": "6474058-1", "title": "", "text": "A 74-year-old male retired accountant with a background of asthma, atrial fibrillation, and gout presented to our emergency department with syncope following an insidious 6-month history of systemic symptoms. He had had intermittent fevers, 15-kg weight loss, general malaise, regular diaphoresis that occurred day and night, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a nonproductive cough with sporadic morning hemoptysis. His exercise tolerance had reduced from unlimited walking capacity to breathlessness after roughly 2 km. His medications included rivaroxaban, verapamil, digoxin, and fosinopril. He had received a short course of prednisolone 25 mg daily for a flare of gout 3 weeks prior. He had a 50-pack-year ex-smoking history, having given up smoking 30 years prior. He lived independently with his wife. He had undergone outpatient chest computed tomography (CT) 2 months earlier that showed consolidation in the left lower lobe and a peripheral opacity in the right lung base measuring 14 mm by 12 mm. He had received several courses of oral antibiotics, including amoxicillin for 10 days and doxycycline for 2 weeks for presumed pneumonia. Because of his ongoing cough, he had a repeat CT scan 1 month later that showed resolution of the consolidation but no change in the peripheral opacity. His general practitioner had then referred him to a respiratory specialist, who felt that his illness was in keeping with a pneumonia that was now resolving. He advised withholding fosinopril, cessation of antibiotics, repeat CT scan in 3 months, and follow-up in 3 weeks. Prior to this appointment, he had had the syncopal episode that led to this presentation.\nOn arrival to the emergency department, he felt washed out, with vital signs that were notable for low-grade fever of 38.3 °C, sinus tachycardia to 130 beats per minute, and fluid-responsive hypotension (82/45 mmHg), and his physical examination was largely unremarkable. Investigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.6 × 109/L (neutrophil count 9.1 × 109/L, lymphocyte count 0.9 × 109/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) 119 mg/L (normal range 0–5 mg/L), Streptococcus mitis on blood cultures (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0.030 mg/L [susceptible = MIC < 0.5 mg/L]), and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrating a mobile 30 × 25-mm vegetation on the PV that extended into the right ventricular outflow tract (Figs. and ). Complete destruction of the anterior cusp with severe pulmonary regurgitation was seen. Initial management included intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for a total of 4 and 2 weeks, respectively. A surgical opinion was obtained, but a trial of medical management was advised. The patient felt better, and his inflammatory markers normalized.\nTwo months after antibiotic cessation, the patient still felt well, with a normal WBC count and CRP of 5.3 mg/L (normal range 0–5 mg/L). Cardiac and chest imaging was performed to check resolution of lesions. TTE showed a reduction in the PV vegetation to 29 × 9 mm. A follow-up chest CT scan, however, showed new nodular lesions thought to be due to embolization (Fig. a), suggesting persistent endocarditis. Repeat blood culture results remained negative.\nAfter 3 months, he again began to feel lethargic with breathlessness on exertion. His examination was unremarkable, but his WBC count was 16.1 × 109/L and CRP was 182 mg/L. Results of five sets of blood cultures were negative, and the vegetation size had improved on TTE to 23 × 10 mm. He was then started on a 2-week course of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Again he began to feel well, with improvement in his CRP and WBC count, so he was discharged to home.\nRepeat outpatient CT of the chest 1 month later showed new lesions, including a cavitating lesion (Fig. b). In light of the recurrent lung lesions, he underwent surgical PV replacement. His PV had been destroyed with a perforated anterior leaflet that was completely encompassed by a large vegetation. The other leaflets were untouched. After valve and vegetation excision, a 27-mm Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT tissue valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was inserted. Histology confirmed IE with expansile inflammatory masses composed of fibrin and neutrophils. Small clusters of degenerate bacterial cocci were noted, but a valve culture revealed no growth. The patient made a good recovery on intravenous benzylpenicillin and oral clindamycin. TTE showed a normal-functioning bioprosthetic PV.

The neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia and hypoalgesia in right V2 and V3 trigeminal distributions, and the right eye fissure was smaller than the left. The other vital signs and physical examination were normal.\nLaboratory tests documented mild anemia (red blood cell count 4.22 × 10∧12/L, hemoglobin 124 g/L), hypokalemia (serum potassium level 3.44 mmol/L) with normal renal function. A slight reduction in above indicators may be associated with the patient's anxiety and poor diet due to the facial pain.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA demonstrated a VBD compressing the right ventrolateral region of brainstem and the trigeminal nerve root entry zone (REZ) (). The contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a significant expansion of the basilar artery () and the widest part of the basilar artery was about 12-mm-diameter. Lacunar cerebral infarction was found in bilateral basal ganglia, left thalamus and right periventricular area, and hemosiderin deposition was found in right cerebellar hemisphere. The remainder of the brainstem, brain parenchyma, and cranial nerves appeared normal. Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination identified a basilar artery dissection indicating the delayed image of distal basilar artery and the stratification and retention of contrast agent (). The patient underwent partial basilar dissecting aneurysm embolization based on above evidences.\nImmediately after surgery, pain attacks had adequate initial relief (barrow neurological institute, BNI Grades IIIa). The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without occurrence of other adverse events and continuous to take carbamazepine, which were stopped progressively eventually. The pain disappeared completely and did not need any more medications 6 months later. Three years after surgery, he had experienced no recurrence of the right facial pain. Physical examination including a neurological exam was normal. The final clinical diagnosis was VBD and basilar artery dissection.", "tokens": ["72", "year", "man", "presented", "5", "year", "history", "paroxysmal", "severe", "electrical", "facial", "pain", "v2", "v3", "trigeminal", "distributions", "complained", "typical", "tic", "douloureux", "episodes", "pain", "triggered", "washing", "face", "brushing", "teeth", "cold", "water", "relieved", "counter", "medications", "year", "disease", "magnetic", "resonance", "angiogram", "mra", "showed", "vertebrobasilar", "dolichoectasia", "patient", "underwent", "microvascular", "decompression", "mvd", "surgery", "facial", "pain", "completely", "resolved", "immediately", "postoperatively", "recurred", "5", "months", "surgery", "accepted", "treatment", "carbamazepine", "600", "mg", "day", "gabapentin", "900", "mg", "day", "complete", "pain", "relief", "pain", "resumed", "time", "treatment", "reduced", "patient", "reported", "alalia", "visual", "numbness", "paralysis", "patient", "arterial", "hypertension", "treated", "indapamide", "diabetes", "history", "trauma", "tumor", "multiple", "sclerosis", "related", "tn", "smoker", "drinker", "40", "pack", "years", "physical", "examination", "revealed", "developed", "anxious", "male", "neurological", "examination", "revealed", "hypoesthesia", "hypoalgesia", "v2", "v3", "trigeminal", "distributions", "eye", "fissure", "smaller", "left", "vital", "signs", "physical", "examination", "normal", "laboratory", "tests", "documented", "mild", "anemia", "red", "blood", "cell", "count", "4", "22", "10", "12", "l", "hemoglobin", "124", "g", "l", "hypokalemia", "serum", "potassium", "level", "3", "44", "mmol", "l", "normal", "renal", "function", "slight", "reduction", "indicators", "patient", "s", "anxiety", "poor", "diet", "due", "facial", "pain", "magnetic", "resonance", "imaging", "mri", "mra", "demonstrated", "vbd", "compressing", "ventrolateral", "region", "brainstem", "trigeminal", "nerve", "root", "entry", "zone", "rez", "contrast", "enhanced", "mri", "revealed", "significant", "expansion", "basilar", "artery", "widest", "part", "basilar", "artery", "12", "mm", "diameter", "lacunar", "cerebral", "infarction", "found", "bilateral", "basal", "ganglia", "left", "thalamus", "periventricular", "area", "hemosiderin", "deposition", "found", "cerebellar", "hemisphere", "remainder", "brainstem", "brain", "parenchyma", "cranial", "nerves", "appeared", "normal", "subsequent", "digital", "subtraction", "angiography", "dsa", "examination", "identified", "basilar", "artery", "dissection", "indicating", "delayed", "image", "distal", "basilar", "artery", "stratification", "retention", "contrast", "agent", "patient", "underwent", "partial", "basilar", "dissecting", "aneurysm", "embolization", "based", "evidences", "immediately", "surgery", "pain", "attacks", "adequate", "initial", "relief", "barrow", "neurological", "institute", "bni", "grades", "iiia", "patient", "discharged", "postoperative", "day", "7", "occurrence", "adverse", "events", "continuous", "carbamazepine", "stopped", "progressively", "eventually", "pain", "disappeared", "completely", "medications", "6", "months", "years", "surgery", "experienced", "recurrence", "facial", "pain", "physical", "examination", "including", "neurological", "exam", "normal", "final", "clinical", "diagnosis", "vbd", "basilar", "artery", "dissection"]}

{"_id": "6763404-1", "title": "", "text": "A 69-year-old Japanese man with a history of anal fistula presented with diarrhea, intermittent fever and wasting. He did not have any specific family history. He had moved to a Southeast Asian country 12 years earlier, and he started having persistent diarrhea 2 years later. He came back to Japan to visit an outside hospital and was diagnosed as IBS, because stool culture and colonoscopy were normal, and the parasite infection studies were negative. Four years later, his diarrhea worsened with occasional fever. These symptoms continued to worsen for the subsequent year, and his body weight decreased 6 kg over 6 months. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. However, computed tomography (CT) study of the abdomen detected jejunal wall thickening. Therefore, he was admitted to our institution for further evaluations.\nThe patient’s vitals were within normal limits, and his physical examinations were benign. The initial laboratory data were only notable for albumin 3.4 g/dL and C-reactive protein 1.83 mg/dL, but the other routine blood cell count and biochemical investigations, including lactate dehydrogenase, were within normal reference ranges (Table ). Repeat CT of abdomen and pelvis with or without contrast in our institution revealed diffuse abnormal thickening of the jejunum and the ileum with enlarged regional lymph nodes at the mesenteries (Fig. a, b). Repeat gastroscopy and colonoscopy performed in our institution were normal and were the same as the ones at the outside hospital. Subsequent pathological results of the random biopsies from the esophagus to the second portion of duodenum and from the terminal ileum to the rectum showed nothing significant including lymphoid infiltration. However, SBE revealed ceaseless villous atrophy throughout most of his jejunum and ileum without any mass, ulceration or stenosis (Fig. a–d). Histopathology of the SBE biopsy specimens from the jejunum and the ileum showed loss of villous architecture and significant infiltration of small cells in the lamina propria and the submucosal layers (Fig. a). Interestingly, the biopsy specimens from the distal third portion of duodenum did not show any clear endoscopic findings of villous atrophy using SBE but still consisted of the same lymphocyte infiltrate (data not shown). Microscopy under high power magnification revealed that these infiltrating mononuclear cells had relatively low nuclear grade, and the presence of lymphocytes in the epithelial layer were mostly normal (Fig. b). Immunohistochemistry (IHC, Fig. a–c) and flow cytometry (data not shown) showed that majority of such lymphocytes expressed CD3, CD5 and CD7 accompanied by aberrant CD20 expression, but not other B cell or natural killer (NK) cell-markers. In addition, IHC also showed that less than 10% of infiltrating cells expressed Ki-67 (Fig. d). These cells consisted of CD4+, CD8−, CD30−, CD56−, and Granzyme B−. In situ hybridization did not show Epstein–Barr virus-encoded RNA (data not shown). Additional analysis showed elevated soluble IL-2 receptor 1,470 unit/L, but anti-human T lymphotropic virus 1 antibody (Ab) was not detected (Table ). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detected diffuse small intestinal wall thickening and enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes, but their maximal standardized uptake values were 1.4 and 2.8, respectively, which are considered as low as physiological uptake (Fig. ). In addition, a bone marrow examination showed no infiltration with atypical lymphocytes. Peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) of the GI tract was originally diagnosed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues at the time [], and the findings were considered to be stage II-2 based on the Lugano classification.\nChemotherapy was thus initiated and consisted of pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (THP-COP). However, there was no response in either clinical or histological presentations even after 6 cycles of THP-COP. Afterward, rituximab, an anti-CD20 Ab, was also administered to the patient. However, the symptoms persisted despite this therapy. Subsequently, the WHO classification was revised in 2016–2017, and associated with this, a revised diagnosis of indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder (T-LPD) of the GI tract was made for the patient [–]. Serial sections of SBE biopsy specimens revealed that the majority of infiltrating T cells in the tissue were surprisingly CCR4 positive (Fig. ). Subsequently, mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 Ab, was administered to treat the patient, and all the patient’s symptoms including diarrhea and fever improved.

A surgical resection procedure was scheduled for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Partial resection of the thymus was performed using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and the intraoperative diagnosis was suspected thymoma. The tumor size was 33 × 28 × 20 mm, the operation time was 64 min, and the amount of bleeding was small. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was LELC. Histologically, tumor cells with edematous large and round nuclei formed a solid corded net on the background of dense lymphocyte infiltration.

{"_id": "7138425-1", "title": "", "text": "A 77-year-old female with a history of chronic alcohol abuse presented with dizziness and confusion one month after a right knee replacement for degenerative joint disease. She described her dizziness as “lightheadedness” that was not associated with any specific maneuver or changes in position. Prior to undergoing knee surgery, she had been healthy, independent, and abstinent from alcohol. With the onset of the confusion, her family had found her to be “jittery” with sleep disturbances and difficulty concentrating. On examination, she was found to have impaired orientation to time and slow thought processing. Her Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) was 21/30, consistent with mild cognitive impairment, and the remainder of her systemic exam was unremarkable. A noncontrast CT of the head was negative for an acute intracranial process, and a follow-up MRI of the brain without contrast was unrevealing for underlying abnormality (Figures -). Given her prior history of chronic alcohol intake, supplementation with thiamine and folic acid was initiated.\nOne week later, the patient started to complain of visual hallucinations. An EEG was obtained to rule out seizures and showed bifrontal discharges more visible over the right hemisphere with right frontal faster frequencies suggestive of an increased tendency toward seizures. Generalized background slowing was also observed, suggestive of moderate to severe encephalopathy (Figure ). A repeat brain MRI with contrast showed cortical and subcortical T2 FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral posterior temporal lobes and the left occipital lobe without associated enhancement (Figure ). The MRI demonstrated features suggestive of PRES. Workup including metabolic, infectious, and vasculitic panels in serum and CSF were all unremarkable with the exception of elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at 1:80. A trial of high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g for 5 days) was administered due to concern for central nervous system vasculitis or autoimmune-mediated process. The patient showed no clinical improvement after completing a course of steroid therapy.\nNineteen days after the admission, her condition significantly deteriorated with frequent episodes of agitation and jerky myoclonic movements involving her orofacial and proximal upper limbs. Continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) revealed multifocal epileptiform and generalized discharges, forming multifocal periodic discharges (MfPDs), and generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) at 0.5-1 Hz suggestive of CJD (Figure ). A repeat brain MRI with contrast showed diffuse cortical and subcortical T2 FLAIR hyperintensities without enhancement. Additionally, new diffusion restrictions in frontoparietal, temporal, insular, and occipital cortex were noted consistent with cortical ribboning characteristic of CJD (Figure ). A repeat lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF was sent for 14-3-3 and t-tau protein analysis.\nTwenty-five days after the admission, she became increasingly somnolent and less responsive and was subsequently intubated.

The patient presented to the Otolaryngology Clinic with complaints of hemoptysis, odynophonia, and odynophagia. She expressed waking several times in two weeks choking on blood and the feeling of “water in her throat” when she coughed. She also showed recent upper respiratory infection symptoms with rhinorrhea and cough.\nShe had a pertinent past medical history of metastatic breast cancer with metastasis in the lungs, neck, and bone. Since starting chemotherapy, she had a history of iron deficiency anemia, menorrhagia, hematochezia, and thrombocytopenia. She was previously treated with docetaxel, standard trastuzumab, and pertuzumab every three weeks for six doses. Due to progression of disease, her chemotherapeutic regimen was changed to T-DM1, zolendronic acid, and tamoxifen. Her last infusion of T-DM1 was 26 days prior to the incidence of hemoptysis and had 15 total infusions of T-DM1 prior to presentation.\nA complete head and neck examination was performed, including nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, which revealed a friable, excoriated nasal septum, bilateral vocal fold edema with ulceration of vocal folds, and no associated submucosal hemorrhage, with epithelial bleeding noted on the supraglottic and glottic surfaces. There was no surrounding ecchymosis (Figures and ). The patient had no prior history of laryngeal mucosal bleeding. We recommended admission to the hospital to rule out pulmonary hemorrhage, in addition to airway monitoring, humidification, cough suppression, and laryngopharyngeal reflux prevention. She was evaluated with computed tomography scan which was negative for contributing factors. The Pulmonology team determined that this was not related to progression of metastatic lung lesions or lung-related hemoptysis. Laryngoscopy was completed 24 hours after admission. Findings included petechia of the supraglottis, false vocal folds, interarytenoid region, and scabbing of the vocal folds (Figures and ). Hematology and Oncology teams were consulted to evaluate for possible bleeding disorders, and von Willebrand disease was ruled out via laboratory studies. The patient was discharged with vocal hygiene and humidification. Upon discharge from the hospital, she has been followed in the Otolaryngology Clinic at four different occasions. Follow-up examinations revealed no further laryngeal hemorrhage but did reveal new, profuse, and recurrent epistaxis laryngitis, differential diagnosis including staphlococcus.

{"_id": "7530230-1", "title": "", "text": "A 28-year-old female patient applied for an elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, she had a BMI of 40.8 kg/m2. (Weight: 98 kg, Height: 1.55 m). She is a known case of hypothyroidism on levothyroxine 50 mcg. She tried to lose weight using multiple diets, all of which have failed.\nDuring the patients’ pre-operative assessment, full physical examination was performed. Upon palpating the abdomen, the stomach was felt on the right side instead of the usual left. This raised doubts about the presence of a type of heterotaxy.\nRoutine laboratory tests including complete blood count, renal and liver function test, coagulation profile, and thyroid function test were all performed, all were within normal ranges. Moreover, chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were both insignificant. She was also seen by the anesthesiologist and was cleared for surgery.\nIn regards to imaging, contrast study of the stomach and duodenum, using gastrograffin meal, was done which showed the stomach located on the right side of the abdomen, and jejunal loops on the left upper part of the abdomen, with no evidence gastro-esophageal reflux or hiatus hernia. After that, abdominal ultrasound was performed with limited visualization due to the patients obesity. A left sided enlarged liver with a normal gallbladder were the only findings. These findings has led to the need for a CT scan for proper visualization of the patients’ anatomy.\nThe CT abdomen with intravenous contrast was performed pre-operatively, where multiple significant findings were seen and diagnosis of Polysplenia Syndrome was confirmed. These findings include a right-sided stomach, a duodenum crossing anterior to mesenteric vessels, complete intestinal malrotation as the small bowels are on the left side and the large bowel on the right side, and the terminal ileum and cecum are midline. Other finding include, right sided splenules with a parent spleen, a midline liver, and infra-renal IVC with infra-hepatic interruption. The partially seen apex of the heart was at the left side. The gallbladder, adrenals, and urinary bladder showed no abnormality. The impression was that these features are suggestive of Polysplenia Syndrome/left isomerism (, ).\nLaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was then performed by a bariatric surgeon under general anesthesia, with the patient in supine position. Starting with insufflation of the abdomen by a Veress needle at the right upper quadrant to create a pneumoperitoneum. Four ports were inserted under vision starting from the supraumbilical port; 11 mm, right and left midclavicular line; 5 and 15 mm respectively, and a 5 mm port at the epigastric area. The 15 mm port was inserted on the left to comply with the patients’ anatomy. The intraoperative findings include a large fatty midline liver, a right sided stomach, with a spleen posterior to it (). Dissection was started at the gastrocolic ligament at 6 cm from the incisura by using a 5 mm ultrasonic device (LigaSure). The dissection continued from the incisura to the angle of His, with sealing of the short gastric vessels. The posterior attachment with the stomach was then removed. Bougie size 38 was inserted up to the pylorus, then 2 blacks and 3 purples were inserted using a reinforced stapler device (Signia). The hemostasis was reinsured then methylene blue test was done, as it is regularly performed, showing no leak or twist. The resected stomach was removed from the 15 mm port. Closure of the 15 mm port fascia was done using Vicryl and Endoclose. The skin incisions were closed subcuticularly, using Monocryl.\nThe only difference in this approach from the one used in the situs solitus patients undergoing LSG is the location of the 15 mm port, as it was inserted on the left midclavicular line instead of the right.\nDay one post-operatively, imaging was performed to rule out incision site leak using single water-soluble contrast study of the stomach and duodenum, using gastrograffin meal, during which, free flow of the oral contrast is noted through the esophagus into the neo-stomach with no evidence of contrast leakage. The stomach emptied well into the duodenum, showing no evidence of contrast leak post laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (, ). This imaging is not regularly done; however, it was advised due to the patients’ anatomy.\nThe patient was discharged on post-operative day two, after drinking approximately 800 mL of clear fluids. She was not complaining of any nausea or vomiting. Her pain was tolerated with paracetamol and was improving gradually. She also passed urine, flatus, and stool normally. She was seen by a dietitian and consulted regarding the proper diet after LSG. She was encouraged to have a clear fluid diet of one to two Liters a day until her next follow up. Mobility and exercise were also recommended.\nTwo and four weeks after the surgery, she was seen in the out-patient clinic for a follow up.

{"_id": "7541294-1", "title": "", "text": "A 5-year-old girl presented to our department with high fever, headache, and vomiting for 2 days, and a high inflammatory response was found. She had commenced amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/day) a day before presentation. She never had a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a history of fever without a focus. Her general condition was good, and physical examination showed mild redness in the throat and no signs of Kawasaki disease. Laboratory tests revealed a high inflammatory response (white blood cell count [WBC], 21,080/μL [neutrophil, 85.8%]; C-reactive protein [CRP] level, 19.5 mg/dL), and a bacterial infection was suspected. Although no bacteria were identified in the urine on Gram staining, the urine test showed WBC > 100/high-power field, and we diagnosed her with a UTI. We administered both ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day) and cefotaxime (150 mg/kg/day) intravenously.\nA day after admission, gram-negative rods were detected from blood cultures. Although she continued to have a high fever, her general condition was good, and recurrent blood tests showed that the CRP levels had reduced to 14.1 mg/dL. We could not detect any signs of hydronephrosis, acute focal bacterial nephritis, or renal abscesses on renal ultrasound. We thought that the antibiotics were effective and therefore continued with the same treatment. However, the fever was prolonged, continuing on the third day of admission when contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed, and signs of renal abscess in the left kidney were observed (Fig. ). On the same day, blood cultures came back positive for ESBL-producing E. coli. We then changed the antibiotics to meropenem (120 mg/kg/day).\nWe did not perform drainage of the renal abscess because the mass was only 10 mm and too small to puncture. ESBL-producing E. coli were also detected in the urine cultures obtained on admission. Her fever resolved on day 5, and there was no recurrent fever. After 3 weeks of treatment with meropenem, improvements of the left kidney abscess were observed on repeat CT scanning (Fig. ). Although poor contrast enhancement remained in the area where the abscess was located, we did not perform another CT scan to check for further improvement to avoid exposing the patient to additional radiation. Technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scanning conducted 4 months after the onset of symptoms revealed the presence of renal scarring in the upper and lower poles of the left kidney along the low-density areas in the initial CT scan (Fig. ). No signs of vesicoureteral reflux were found with a voiding cystourethrogram, and no decrease in renal function was found on laboratory examination. At the 1-year follow-up, she had no recurrence of the abscess or renal sequelae such as hypertension, proteinuria, or impaired kidney function.", "tokens": ["5", "year", "girl", "presented", "department", "high", "fever", "headache", "vomiting", "2", "days", "high", "inflammatory", "response", "found", "commenced", "amoxicillin", "40", "mg", "kg", "day", "day", "presentation", "urinary", "tract", "infection", "uti", "history", "fever", "focus", "general", "condition", "good", "physical", "examination", "showed", "mild", "redness", "throat", "signs", "kawasaki", "disease", "laboratory", "tests", "revealed", "high", "inflammatory", "response", "white", "blood", "cell", "count", "wbc", "21", "080", "μl", "neutrophil", "85", "8", "c", "reactive", "protein", "crp", "level", "19", "5", "mg", "dl", "bacterial", "infection", "suspected", "bacteria", "identified", "urine", "gram", "staining", "urine", "test", "showed", "wbc", "100", "high", "power", "field", "diagnosed", "uti", "administered", "ampicillin", "150", "mg", "kg", "day", "cefotaxime", "150", "mg", "kg", "day", "intravenously", "day", "admission", "gram", "negative", "rods", "detected", "blood", "cultures", "continued", "high", "fever", "general", "condition", "good", "recurrent", "blood", "tests", "showed", "crp", "levels", "reduced", "14", "1", "mg", "dl", "detect", "signs", "hydronephrosis", "acute", "focal", "bacterial", "nephritis", "renal", "abscesses", "renal", "ultrasound", "thought", "antibiotics", "effective", "continued", "treatment", "fever", "prolonged", "continuing", "day", "admission", "contrast", "enhanced", "computed", "tomography", "ct", "performed", "signs", "renal", "abscess", "left", "kidney", "observed", "fig", "day", "blood", "cultures", "back", "positive", "esbl", "producing", "e", "coli", "changed", "antibiotics", "meropenem", "120", "mg", "kg", "day", "perform", "drainage", "renal", "abscess", "mass", "10", "mm", "small", "puncture", "esbl", "producing", "e", "coli", "detected", "urine", "cultures", "obtained", "admission", "fever", "resolved", "day", "5", "recurrent", "fever", "3", "weeks", "treatment", "meropenem", "improvements", "left", "kidney", "abscess", "observed", "repeat", "ct", "scanning", "fig", "poor", "contrast", "enhancement", "remained", "area", "abscess", "located", "perform", "ct", "scan", "check", "improvement", "avoid", "exposing", "patient", "additional", "radiation", "technetium", "99", "m", "dimercaptosuccinic", "acid", "renal", "scanning", "conducted", "4", "months", "onset", "symptoms", "revealed", "presence", "renal", "scarring", "upper", "lower", "poles", "left", "kidney", "low", "density", "areas", "initial", "ct", "scan", "fig", "signs", "vesicoureteral", "reflux", "found", "voiding", "cystourethrogram", "decrease", "renal", "function", "found", "laboratory", "examination", "1", "year", "follow", "recurrence", "abscess", "renal", "sequelae", "hypertension", "proteinuria", "impaired", "kidney", "function"]}
{"_id": "7580380-1", "title": "", "text": "A seventy-six years old lady presented to our Emergency Department with complaints of progressive worsening of headache eleven days in duration and acute onset of several episodes of vomiting since the past two days. She was referred from another center where she was treated symptomatically with no relief of either pain or vomiting. She reported no weakness or numbness of upper and lower limbs. There was no history of fever, abnormal body movements and loss of consciousness. She reported decreased appetite and alteration of sleep habit. She did not give any history of recent trauma or falls. She however gave a history of head surgery 20 years back for a subdural hematoma that she had due to a fall and a leg fracture 7 years ago which was fixed with plates. An interesting revelation was that the patient had remained unconscious for three months following her previous surgery for SDH evacuation.\nOn examination, she was ill-looking. Her vitals were normal. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination were normal with a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg , pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (Sp02) of 98%. She was afebrile, conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 and normal neurologic exam, including that of cranial nerves. Tone, power and reflexes were normal in both upper as well as lower limbs. Sensations to all four limbs were also preserved. Palpation of spine revealed no tenderness or steps.\nInitial laboratory investigations including random blood glucose, hematological profile including that of clotting, liver and renal function tests and other basic tests were normal. A non-contrast CT scan of the head was ordered in the ER which revealed a small hyperdense area surrounded by hypodense areas indicating acute on chronic, right subdural hematoma with a small acute bleed around the temporal lobe and a chronic bleed around the temporoparietal region. The CT also showed a massive hypodense area indicating a large subdural hematoma on the left temporoparietal region, with a very slight midline shift to the right, to go along with a previous burr hole mark on the left temporal bone ().\nA neurosurgical referral was made. She was monitored intensively and treated conservatively with no improvement of her symptoms. Surgery was then planned. A left parietal burr-hole craniostomy was done under local anaesthesia, the following day with aspiration of “machinery-oil” blood under pressure. The headache resolved. The next day after the surgery, the patient complained of headache on the side opposite to which the procedure was performed. The patient was closely monitored in the neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit. After the pain persisted for a day more, a repeat head CT was ordered. It revealed isodense to slightly hyperdense areas in the right temporo-parietal region with a slight midline shift to the left ().\nA right parietal burr-hole craniostomy was performed under local anaesthesia which led to aspiration of dark brown blood under pressure. A repeat CT of the head showed resolution of the hematoma ().\nThree days after the second procedure, the patient complained of frontal headache and nausea. The patient was febrile as well. Repeat CT showed a large bi-frontal pneumocephalus ().\nA chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. These problems were managed medically with high flow oxygen therapy and intravenous antibiotics and the patient recovered eventually ().

{"_id": "7678886-1", "title": "", "text": "A 59-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency room with a history of fever, headache, drowsiness, and body pains for one week. Suspecting viral encephalitis, acyclovir was initiated. The patient had one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) post-admission. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain ruled out a cerebrovascular accident. CSF analysis did not show features of meningoencephalitis. Serum sodium was 122 meq/mol. Hyponatremia was suspected as the cause of the GTCS, and the patient was started on 3% normal saline. The patient recovered, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 was noted. However, six hours later, she became drowsy and went into respiratory failure with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55, prompting non-invasive ventilatory support. The patient had one more episode of GTCS. On examination following that episode, she had altered sensorium, disorientation, confusion, and faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), hinting at autoimmune encephalitis. A serum autoimmune panel was ordered, which came back negative. Three anti-epileptic drugs, namely, sodium valproate, phenytoin, and levetiracetam, were started. However, the patient continued to have recurrent complex partial seizures. She developed hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, indicating autonomic dysfunction. Infectious causes, including herpes simplex, chikungunya, cytomegalovirus, and dengue were ruled out. Procalcitonin was normal. The autonomic dysfunction was treated with nitroglycerine and dexmedetomidine infusion. Despite this, the patient had continuous faciobrachial dystonia and cataplexy. Methylprednisolone, 1 g/day, was started. Paraneoplastic causes were ruled out through CT scans and tumor markers. The patient required ventilator support because of recurrent status epilepticus and autonomic instability. As she continued to have recurrent seizures despite steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins were initiated. The patient had persistent seizures on the ventilator with four antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam, phenytoin, sodium valproate, clonazepam), and propofol infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/hr. A diagnosis of super-refractory status epilepticus was made because of persistent seizures after 24 hrs of propofol infusion. Repeat MRI of the brain showed medial temporal lobe hyperintensity. Thiopentone, 3 mg/kg/hr, was started for burst suppression and the dosage was increased to a maximum of 6 mg/kg/hr. Midazolam, 2 mg/hr, was continued, along with thiopentone, and an intermittent bolus of thiopentone was given.\nAfter three days of thiopentone infusion, the EEG showed a generalized, reduced spike pattern. The thiopentone dose was reduced and eventually stopped, but she continued to have faciobrachial dystonia. Suspecting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor encephalitis, magnesium sulfate, 1 g/hr, and ketamine infusion, 1.5 mg/kg/hr, were started and were continued for one week. The FBDS persisted, prompting the initiation of second-line immunotherapy with rituximab, 625 mg (at 375 mg/m2) with serial CD19 and CD20 antibody monitoring.\nThe patient improved neurologically with reduced spikes on EEG.

The second day of admission, she developed high fever initially not responding to antipyretics, and she became generally unwell with a dry cough. The patient and her mother had COVID-19-like symptoms approximately a month prior to admission; unfortunately, no confirmation with PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained at that time. Additional characteristics, laboratory findings, and chest X-ray results are shown in .\nEpileptic activity increased, and she needed seizure medication. Because of seizures and the risk of aspiration pneumonia, intravenous co-amoxiclav was empirically initiated. She gradually deteriorated needing oxygen therapy. Because fever persisted and inflammation parameters were rising, intravenous antibiotic therapy was switched to third generation cephalosporins. Cardiac ultrasound, ECG, and echocardiography were planned, as well as a chest CT which all showed signs of pericarditis (see ).\nOur patient did not meet the criteria for Kawasaki disease but appeared to be an atypical Kawasaki-like shock syndrome. A trial of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) was administered. Although none of the cultures (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, and bronchial aspirates) yielded positive, antibiotics were continued for 10 days. Shortly after IVIG treatment, the patient clinically improved significantly although moderate fever persisted and inflammatory parameters dropped swiftly (as visualized in ).

{"_id": "7813979-1", "title": "", "text": "An 18-year-old male patient presented with a history of mass and pain in the thigh. After the imaging, a biopsy was taken confirming the final diagnosis of a high-grade chondroblastic/osteoblastic osteosarcoma of the distal femur stage IIB (Figure ).\nThe patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with MAP (methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum), and limb salvage surgery was subsequently performed in October 2000. For the reconstruction, an osteochondral allograft fixed with a rigid stainless steel plate was selected. In the postoperative period, the extremity was immobilized with an articulated brace until some signs of union in the imaging were observed. The patient successfully completed the adjuvant chemotherapy course without evidence of recurrence or metastasis. The allograft unfortunately progressed to non-union, and after one year of the fixation (November 2001) a fracture in the plate was identified. The case was discussed and the decision was to revise the osteosynthesis. In the subsequent follow-up, weight-bearing was restricted until consolidation was achieved. During the rehabilitation process, an articulated brace in the knee was prescribed, with the association of progressive gain in quadriceps strength.\nOne year after the last surgery (November 2002), the dislocation of the extensor mechanism and posteromedial femorotibial subluxation was identified. The range of movement at this time was acceptable (10° to 90°), and the pain was manageable; therefore, no further intervention was performed until January 2004, when the patient presented with pain. At this time, several osteoarthritic changes were observed, and for that reason the knee joint was replaced with a constrained revision implant. The results were satisfactory with early recovery in the range of movement (0°-100°), without leg length discrepancy and adequate strength to achieve gait without external aids. In November 2006 (two years after the last intervention), the patient presented to the clinic with sudden loss in the range of movement and with pain. New imaging identified a supracondylar fracture in the allograft, with the subsequent failure of the knee implant (Figure ).\nAfter considering the options available, the therapeutic decision was to perform a revision with a new APC, as it was felt that an endoprosthetic replacement would lead to important bone loss. The patient had the new intervention in February 2007, in which the fractured allograft was removed and a new massive bone allograft was placed. The reconstruction was stabilized with a revision prosthesis with a long femoral stem (28 cm) and a 12-hole plate with cables (Figure ).\nThe clinical progression was adequate, with a recovery of the movement and a decrease in the preoperative pain levels. During the follow-up, the integration of the bone graft was observed, with the maintenance of appropriate alignment and relationship between the prosthesis, the bone allograft, and the native bone (Figures , ).\nAt present, the patient is 36 years old and has been followed for 10 years since the last intervention. He is able to walk without any external aids, with no leg length discrepancy. He can perform full extension of the knee and flexion up to 90° (Figure ).\nAt the last visit to the clinic, no further surgical interventions have been required.", "tokens": ["18", "year", "male", "patient", "presented", "history", "mass", "pain", "thigh", "imaging", "biopsy", "confirming", "final", "diagnosis", "high", "grade", "chondroblastic", "osteoblastic", "osteosarcoma", "distal", "femur", "stage", "iib", "figure", "patient", "received", "neoadjuvant", "chemotherapy", "map", "methotrexate", "doxorubicin", "cisplatinum", "limb", "salvage", "surgery", "subsequently", "performed", "october", "2000", "reconstruction", "osteochondral", "allograft", "fixed", "rigid", "stainless", "steel", "plate", "selected", "postoperative", "period", "extremity", "immobilized", "articulated", "brace", "signs", "union", "imaging", "observed", "patient", "successfully", "completed", "adjuvant", "chemotherapy", "evidence", "recurrence", "metastasis", "allograft", "progressed", "union", "year", "fixation", "november", "2001", "fracture", "plate", "identified", "case", "discussed", "decision", "revise", "osteosynthesis", "subsequent", "follow", "weight", "bearing", "restricted", "consolidation", "achieved", "rehabilitation", "process", "articulated", "brace", "knee", "prescribed", "association", "progressive", "gain", "quadriceps", "strength", "year", "surgery", "november", "2002", "dislocation", "extensor", "mechanism", "posteromedial", "femorotibial", "subluxation", "identified", "range", "movement", "time", "acceptable", "10", "90", "pain", "manageable", "intervention", "performed", "january", "2004", "patient", "presented", "pain", "time", "osteoarthritic", "observed", "reason", "knee", "joint", "replaced", "constrained", "revision", "implant", "results", "satisfactory", "early", "recovery", "range", "movement", "0", "100", "leg", "length", "discrepancy", "adequate", "strength", "achieve", "gait", "external", "aids", "november", "2006", "years", "intervention", "patient", "presented", "clinic", "sudden", "loss", "range", "movement", "pain", "imaging", "identified", "supracondylar", "fracture", "allograft", "subsequent", "failure", "knee", "implant", "figure", "options", "therapeutic", "decision", "perform", "revision", "apc", "felt", "endoprosthetic", "replacement", "lead", "important", "bone", "loss", "patient", "intervention", "february", "2007", "fractured", "allograft", "removed", "massive", "bone", "allograft", "reconstruction", "stabilized", "revision", "prosthesis", "long", "femoral", "stem", "28", "cm", "12", "hole", "plate", "cables", "figure", "clinical", "progression", "adequate", "recovery", "movement", "decrease", "preoperative", "pain", "levels", "follow", "integration", "bone", "graft", "observed", "maintenance", "alignment", "relationship", "prosthesis", "bone", "allograft", "native", "bone", "figures", "present", "patient", "36", "years", "10", "years", "intervention", "walk", "external", "aids", "leg", "length", "discrepancy", "perform", "full", "extension", "knee", "flexion", "90", "figure", "visit", "clinic", "surgical", "interventions", "required"]}

The sternal wound was healing slowly, but there were no signs of infection.\nPast surgical history included sterilisation in 1962, haemorrhoidectomy in 1983 and hysterectomy for fibroids in 1985. None of these operations had resulted in scar hypertrophy. No other significant medical history was present.\nShe made an uncomplicated recovery from her mitral valve surgery and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). In the next 9 months, she noticed increasing pain and thickness of the sternotomy and previous chest drain scars. She was initially treated by her GP with local anti-inflammatory agents with no noticeable improvement. She searched for other treatment options on the internet and chose to use Cica-Care™ (Smith & Nephew™), a silicone gel sheet for six months with little relief. At that stage her GP referred her to a plastic surgeon and a pain therapist who treated her with local steroid and lidocaine injections for approximately 4 years with no improvement. Eventually she was seen by her cardiologist who referred her back to our cardiothoracic unit.\nHer clinical examination confirmed a 12 cm long keloid scar at the site of the sternotomy and two other keloid scars inferiorly at the site of previous chest drains and pacing wires. (Figure )\nThese were extremely tender on light palpation, particularly over the site of the sternal wires. None of the wires were palpable. Following discussion on treatment options she agreed to have surgical excision of the scar and primary closure.\nIn November 2008, the patient underwent excision of the keloid scar with removal of the sternal wires and reconstruction of the wound with three layers of suture (1 Dexon™ Covidien UK™) under general anaesthetic. Mobilisation of the subcutaneous tissues was required for approximation of the skin edges. Skin was closed with Prolene™ (Ethicon™). Sutures were removed after ten days and a pressure dressing was applied. We were not sure if this patient was allergic to the Monocryl™ and we therefore chose to use a removable material such as Prolene™. The histology of the keloid scar did not show evidence of malignancy.\nThe hypertrophied scar at the pacing wire site was deliberately left untouched in order to compare any future scar formation. (Figure ) She was discharged home three days later. (Figure )\nThe patient was reviewed in the outpatients clinic six weeks later. The wound was healing well with minimal tenderness over the scar sites (Figure ). Nine months after excision there was evidence of recurrence of her scar, however this was of a lesser degree (Figure ).

No fracture was seen, but an osteolytic area was found in the ulnar meta-epiphysis. The initial diagnosis was ‘juvenile bone cyst’. The patient presented with a painful swelling at the wrist dorsal ulnar side, about 2.5 cm, in the absence of any epidermal dyschromias. The skin was elastic and smooth. Wrist examination showed a range of motion (ROM) of 45 ° of extension, 70 ° of flexion, 15 ° of radial deviation and 10 ° of ulnar deviation; pronation, supination and circumduction were painful. Contralateral wrist ROM was normal. The diagnosis of ‘juvenile bone cyst’ did not seem right and a second radiographic examination was performed. At this time, a multilocular osteolytic area inducing an expansion of the distal ulna was seen. A cortical bone interruption was also visible. Although the patient had been the victim of a trauma, this was a poor prognostic sign. Therefore an Magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed.

{"_id": "3459811-1", "title": "", "text": "A 63-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital for chronic hepatitis C treatment. His initial physical examination results were unremarkable.

Serum viral load was estimated to 3,545,770IU/mL (6.5log) with a genotype 2a2c. The assessment of liver fibrosis by FibroTest® and FibroScan® revealed a stage F2 of fibrosis. An abdominal ultrasound did not find any signs of portal hypertension or cirrhosis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not find any endoscopic signs of portal hypertension. He was started on a course of treatment comprising PEG-interferon α2a (PEGASYS®) 180μg subcutaneously per week and ribavirin 800mg/day in divided doses orally. A rapid virological response was obtained after four weeks.\nIn the fifth week of treatment, he reported painful paresthesia, tingling, numbness, and weakness of his lower extremities. His neurological symptoms progressed rapidly over the course of one week to the point of losing the ability to ambulate. In addition, our patient also complained of tingling and numbness in the upper extremities involving the fingers and wrists bilaterally. PEGASYS® was discontinued due to an acute onset of weakness of the upper and lower extremities. A neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerves with normal bulk of muscles and tone; but weak muscle strength in the upper extremities as well as in the hips, knees, ankles and toes bilaterally. His tendon reflexes were diminished significantly. A sensory examination revealed decreased light touch, pinprick, and temperature sensation from the feet to mid-calves as well as hands, except for vibratory sense. A clinical diagnosis of acquired acute inflammatory demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy was made. Biochemical screening tests, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, serum cryoglobulin level, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test and cytomegalovirus (CMV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were all normal. The results of an electromyogram (EMG) revealed evidence of predominant motor polyneuropathy with prominent demyelinating features, including motor conduction block, low conduction velocity, and prolonged minimum F wave latency in the bilateral ulnar, median, peroneal, and tibial nerves (Table ). Our patient recovered completely after one month of stopping interferon (without stopping ribavirin) and symptomatic treatment. His muscle weakness and paresthesia were markedly improved, with normal strength in all muscle groups; eventually he could walk without difficulty. A further EMG showed a disappearance of neuropathy. Four weeks later, IFN was reintroduced with a gradually increasing dose (90μg for two months, then 120μg for one month followed by 180μg for the two remaining months) without reappearance of neurological symptoms.

He was admitted to our hospital in June 2009 due to right upper quadrant pain and bloody diarrhea. Urinalysis revealed an absence of proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. There was no deterioration of renal function as determined by blood urea nitrogen (BUN, 5.9 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.9 mg/dL) analysis. Colonoscopic examination revealed linear, geographic ulcers with non-caseating granulomas in the distal ileum. The patient was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and treated with 3 g/day of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine) and 9 mg/day of budesonide.\nIn July 2009, the patient visited the emergency room with right lower quadrant pain, loose stool, and fever. Simple abdominal X-ray showed free air below the diaphragm. He was diagnosed with an ascending colon perforation and underwent an emergency right hemicolectomy. Budesonide administration was discontinued, and the 5-ASA dosage was reduced to 2 g/day. The patient was additionally treated with ciprofloxacin (1 g/day) and metronidazole (1.5 g/day), and was kept under observation for 2 weeks. After this time, he had intermittent loose stools (0–2 times/day) without abdominal pain. Next, the patient was given 5-ASA (2 g/day) as maintenance therapy and his intestinal symptoms improved.\nIn December 2010, the patient experienced exacerbation of his symptoms, with non-bloody diarrhea three to four times daily. Colonoscopy revealed geographic ulcers consistent with Crohn’s disease. His blood pressure was 127/76 mmHg. Laboratory test results showed normal BUN (10.1 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.76 mg/dL) levels. Although urinalysis revealed mild proteinuria (1+ according to a dipstick test) and microscopic hematuria, the patient did not have a nephrology consultation. The patient was treated with 5-ASA (1 g/day) and budesonide (6 mg/day). After treatment, his abdominal pain ceased and no more loose stools were experienced until March 2011.\nIn March 2011, the patient experienced dark loose stools three times daily, and developed pale conjunctiva. He complained of facial puffiness and edema in his lower extremities. His blood pressure was 137/96 mmHg. Proteinuria (2+ by a dipstick test) and microscopic hematuria were detected by urinalysis. His renal function had deteriorated, with increased BUN (30.3 mg/dL) and creatinine (3.42 mg/dL) levels. He was referred to a nephrology clinic and admitted for evaluation.\nHis height was 170 cm and his body weight was 43 kg. A 24-h urine study revealed the presence of proteinuria (3,967 mg/day). Further serologic testing revealed a mildly increased IgA level of 492 mg/dL (reference, 70–400 mg/dL) along with normal IgG (670 mg/dL; reference, 700–1,600 mg/dL), IgM (55 mg/dL; reference, 40–230 mg/dL), C3 (126.7 mg/dL; reference, 90–180 mg/dL), and C4 (40.5 mg/dL; reference, 10–40 mg/dL) levels. Test results for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, anti-streptolysin O (ASO) antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), and cryoglobulin were all negative. Serologic tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency viruses were also negative. Renal ultrasonographic findings showed that the kidneys were normal-sized, with increased cortical echogenicity.\nRenal biopsy findings revealed nine crescent formations and eight scleroses in 17 glomeruli. Endocapillary hypercellularity was also present. Inflammatory cells had infiltrated into the interstitium. Mild tubular atrophy with interstitial fibrosis was observed by light microscopy. In the mesangium, immunofluorescence assays revealed 2+ diffuse fine granular staining for IgA and 1+ staining for IgM and C3. Electron microscopy revealed dense deposits in the mesangial area (Figure A, B). The patient was subsequently diagnosed with rapidly progressive IgAN. Two days after the renal biopsy was performed, serum creatinine levels increased from 3.9 mg/dL to 4.8 mg/dL. The patient was treated with prednisolone pulse therapy (250 mg twice daily) for 3 consecutive days; the dose was tapered to 1 mg/kg/day (Figure ). Planned intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy was canceled because the patient developed abdominal symptoms on the fifth day of steroid treatment. He had watery diarrhea 10 times daily, and laboratory data revealed that he suffered from metabolic acidosis caused by severe diarrhea. Blood gas analysis showed the following parameters: pH 7.24, PaCO2 22.4, PaO2 82.6, and HCO3 9.7. His serum chloride level was 121 mmol/L; BUN and serum creatinine levels were 89 and 3.88 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was treated with 5-ASA (2 g/day) and loperamide (6 mg/day). In addition, intravenous fluid therapy was administered to restore volume loss. The watery diarrhea subsided in 2 weeks, and the patient was discharged. He was further treated at the outpatient department with oral doses of deflazacort (48 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day). In July 2011 (3 months after treatment), these doses were tapered to 24 mg/day and 50 mg/day, respectively. 5-ASA dosage was maintained at 2.0 g/day. The patient’s BUN level was 61.2 mg/dL, and his serum creatinine concentration was 2.5 mg/dL. Proteinuria was 2+ by dipstick test, and the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio was 1.8 mg/g.\nIn September 2011, cyclophosphamide was replaced with azathioprine (100 mg/day). One month later, the patient was switched from azathioprine to mycophenolate sodium (360 mg/day) because of bone marrow suppression. His intestinal symptoms were not aggravated, and renal functions were also maintained (33.8 mg/dL BUN and 2.32 mg/dL serum creatinine) while taking mycophenolate sodium (360 mg/day) and deflazacort (12 mg/day) during December 2011.\nTo evaluate pathophysiological characteristics common for the exacerbation of Crohn’s disease and IgAN, as well as possible mediators, we measured interleukin (IL)-17 expression in renal and colon tissues from the patient. We also compared renal IL-17 expression to that in tissues from cases of primary IgAN without Crohn’s disease. Immunostaining for IL-17 was positive in both renal tissue and exacerbated colonic ulcers from the patient (Figure C, D), in comparison, this staining was negative in renal tissues from a patient with primary IgAN (control; Figure E).", "tokens": ["18", "year", "male", "referred", "nephrology", "clinic", "evaluation", "azotemia", "proteinuria", "march", "2011", "patient", "previously", "undergone",

{"_id": "3846247-1", "title": "", "text": "In 2010, a 6-month-old girl with bilateral Tessier facial cleft referred to department of pediatric otolaryngology-head and neck surgery of Tabriz-Iran children hospital. First, a thorough investigation for possibility of associated syndromes and anomalies was conducted. The consultation of pediatrician, neurologist, optometrist and cardiologist did not define any associated anomaly describing a known syndrome. All neuroimaging, hearing studies and urogenital evaluations were normal.\nShe had a left side No.5 Tessier facial cleft, originating in about 10 mm medial to left commissure vermilion extending upward and laterally, making a groove on the cheek and ending at the middle third of lower eye lid, without evidence of ectropion. The medial cantus was properly in its place, but the lateral cantus was lower compared with the right side. Alveolar ridge was involved in association with unilateral complete cleft palate in the same side. Maxilla was split and rotated three dimensionally into lateral, inferior and posterior. Premaxilla was in its proper place; but, lateral alveolar ridge was rotated in the same manner. On her right side, a very mild No.4 Tessier facial cleft started lateral to phylteral column extending superiorly and lateral to right nasal alar, mildly involving alveolar ridge. No involvement of primary and secondary palate was defined ().\nOn the left side, the scar like soft tissue was marked from its high point to vermilion, sparing the commissure. Incisions were made through skin and underlying soft tissue to just above the periosteum. Bonny cleft was lateral to infra orbital foramen, therefore, incision over periosteum and dissection in a sub periosteal plane was made. Soft tissue dissection was made in two planes, one under dermal fat and one in subcutaneous plane, up to two millimeters each side of the incision. All soft tissue and periosteum were drawn medially to obscure the bonny cleft as much as possible and infraorbital neurovascular bundle were preserved laterally. Orbicularis oris muscle dissected bilaterally, preserving the zygomatic complex muscles and sutured to each other. Wet and dry mucosa sutured to each other after reconstructing advancement flaps medially and laterally, using two uni limb Z plasties bilaterally ().\nOn the right side, the same procedure was conducted, which included scar excision, advancing subperiosteal flaps, muscle dissection, reconstructing advancement flaps medially and laterally and one uni limb Z plasty laterally, in conjunction with a back-cut in its upper end to elongate the lateral arm of the incision. Palatoplasty was postponed until the patiant’s10 months of age.\nOrbicularis oris function after operation was observed and it was satisfying when the patient cried or laughed.

{"_id": "3875119-1", "title": "", "text": "A 82-year-old man presented to the emergency room prostrated, with recent onset of fatigue and malaise. A few days earlier, he started feeling urinary urgency and had started treatment with oral fluoroquinolones for an alleged prostatitis.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable, there were no abdominal masses, and Giordano's sign was negative. Laboratory revealed mild anemia (Ht: 33%; Hb: 11.3 mg/dL), leukocytosis (29.570 WBCs/mm3; 1% myelocytes, 6% band neutrophils), and altered renal function tests (serum creatinine: 2.65 mg/dL; urea: 80 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed leukocyturia (10 leukocytes/field) and hematuria (10 blood cells/field). Urine culture was negative.\nA chest X-ray was normal. An abdominal ultrasound showed a 9.6 cm right kidney with poorly defined limits and an internal image suggestive of a choraliform stone. Left kidney was normal, as well as the remainder of the abdominal organs.\nThe patient was started on IV antibiotics (cefepime) and hydration. After the initial treatment, the patient evolved with worsening of his clinical and laboratory findings. A noncontrasting abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the right kidney, in contiguity with the lumbar musculature, the liver, and the vena cava, also dislodging the pancreatic head and the duodenum. In the collecting system of the right kidney, a large choraliform stone was found.\nIn spite of the placement of a percutaneous drain in the perirenal space, the patient worsened, with progressive tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. Renal function, however, improved (serum Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL). An abdominal CT with intravenous (IV) contrast was then ordered and confirmed a large perirenal abscess (), and surgery was indicated. An open radical nephrectomy was performed in the right kidney, which was sent to pathologic examination.\nPathology revealed an 8.0 cm moderately differentiated (Grade 2) squamous carcinoma of the renal pelvis (). Necrosis was present in roughly 30% of the tumor, which extended to the renal parenchyma and the perirenal fat. There was a positive surgical margin in the perihilar region.\nThe patient survived the perioperative period; however, his clinical condition has not evolved as expected.

{"_id": "3881447-1", "title": "", "text": "Our patient is a 63-year-old female with osteoarthritis in the lumbar spine and bilateral knees. Knee X-rays showed bilateral mild osteoarthritic changes. MRI of left knee showed grade II-III patellar chondromalacia and mild osteoarthritic changes. Her left knee pain was uncontrolled with conservative measures including NSAIDs and narcotics. Steroid injections were provided once with no pain relief. Subsequently, over a period of five years, she received multiple courses of sodium hyaluronate injections to the left knee without complications, waiting at least six months between each series of five injections. The skin was thoroughly examined prior to each injection and was noted to be in a good condition, with no breaks, rashes, or bruises evident. She had great pain relief from the Hyalgan injections and repeatedly requested them. Clean technique was employed prior to each of these injections, including use of betadine, alcohol, and gloves.\nPertinent past medical history included treatment for invasive ductal left breast cancer with lumpectomy and radiation five years prior to this hospital presentation. She had been in remission until four months prior to hospitalization, when she was diagnosed with recurrent left breast ductal carcinoma. She then underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and received one round of chemotherapy treatment, with Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin, 11 days prior to hospital admission. The surgery and chemotherapy proceeded without complications.\nFive days after the last sodium hyaluronate injection to the left knee, she presented to the hospital with complaint of left leg pain that woke her from sleep. She initially noticed a small area of erythema in the left popliteal fossa. Over the next few hours, she developed rapidly progressive swelling, expansion of the erythema, and formation of multiple large bullae extending from the thigh to proximal leg. By the time she arrived at the hospital, the bullae and erythema had expanded to the gluteal fold and inguinal region. CT of left lower extremity showed free gas through the adductor musculature and posterior and superior to ischial tuberosity. Given the aggressive symptoms, the patient was emergently taken to operating room for extensive debridement and amputation at the lesser trochanter. She was then admitted to intensive care unit on broad spectrum antibiotics for septic shock secondary to necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, involving both posterior and anterior compartments.

He smokes five to six cigarettes daily for 10 years, denied alcohol drinking and recreational drug use. He is a retired accountant by profession, lives home independently with unknown history of sexually transmitted infections. During the presentation to the emergency room, he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 96/51 mm Hg, heart rate 62/min, respiratory rate 20/min saturating 90% on room air. On examination, the patient was in acute respiratory distress, with an increased work of breathing, however, no wheezing or crackles on auscultation. Cardiac examination was remarkable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and 2/6 diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. There was no jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or abdominal tenderness. Laboratory workup revealed elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) 8060 pg/mL (<177 pg/mL) troponin 0.141 ng/mL (0.000-0.045 ng/mL) peaked at 0.294 ng/mL. Blood chemistry and coagulation testing were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed isolated ST elevation in lead V3, which was not correlating with acute ischemic changes (Figure ). The chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Figure ). Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was unremarkable for pulmonary embolism but demonstrated a large aortic root aneurysm measuring 5.9 cm (Figure ).\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular dilation with reduced ejection fraction (30-35%) and severe aortic insufficiency as indicated with a large central jet sign (Figure ). There was no evidence of coronary flow limitation or obstruction on the coronary angiogram (Figure ).\nWorkup for the etiology of aortic root aneurysms was only remarkable for a positive syphilis screening test that was confirmed with a positive T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA). Testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV was negative. The patient was diagnosed with tertiary cardiovascular syphilis without evidence of neurosyphilis. The patient was treated with three doses of 2.4 million/unit intravenous (IV) penicillin-G and underwent surgical excision of aortic root aneurysm, aortic valve, aortic root replacement with 27 mm mosaic ultra bioprosthetic valve and 30 mm gelweave graft. Inspection of excised aortic root revealed aortic dissection within the aneurysm and marked inflammation along the left lateral wall of the aneurysm extending to the normal ascending aorta.

{"_id": "8283861-1", "title": "", "text": "A 59-year-old woman without previous history of psychiatric or neurological disease admitted herself to the emergency department of our university hospital with existential fears regarding her state of unemployment. Due to massive anxiety, a structured conversation with the patient was only feasible after anxiolytic treatment with lorazepam. During the clinical examination, it became apparent that the patient's fears were elicited by delusional ideas. The patient claimed that thoughts had been inserted into her head and were being controlled by someone else. Moreover, she reported ideas of audible thoughts. An organic schizophrenia-like disorder was assumed as the most likely diagnosis, and the patient was transferred from the emergency department to the Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry, and Psychotherapy of our clinic. The patient claimed that her mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years and had died at the age of 65 years. Other family members had not been afflicted with neurological or psychiatric disease.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a mild hypothyreosis due to status post hemithyroidectomy; hence, levothyroxine was substituted. Moreover, hyponatremia was identified and sodium chloride tablets were administered. Additionally, the patient was advised to reduce drinking tap water, of which she was consuming up to 4 liters per day. No abnormalities were detected in the complete blood count. Deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B12, and ceruloplasmin as well as infection with human immunodeficiency virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Treponema pallidum could also be excluded.\nAfter completion of the laboratory investigations, we initiated an antipsychotic treatment with risperidone. However, delusional ideas persisted despite treatment with risperidone. Due to sleep disturbances, we commenced a treatment with chlorprothixene, while risperidone was discontinued.\nFurther neurological examination revealed dysdiadochokinesis (predominantly of the left hand), mild hyperkinetic movements (particularly restlessness), bradykinesia in the finger-tapping test, and a broad-based gait. Rigidity, tremor, or postural instability was not present. In the meantime, the patient became increasingly disoriented to time and space and exhibited long-term memory deficits accompanied by episodes of fear, agitation, and perseverations, indicative of cognitive impairment. Cognitive function was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry on Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD+), which detected deficits in recognition of verbal content, a severe impairment of visuospatial abilities, a reduction in semantic and phonological word fluency, and a decreased cognitive flexibility (the latter was additionally evidenced in the Trail Making B test). Furthermore, we performed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMST) and the frontal assessment battery (FAB) where the patient scored 22 out of 30 points and 10 out of 18 points, respectively, indicating reductions in mental flexibility, motor programming, environmental autonomy, and inhibitory control. The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) showed no evidence of a personality disorder, while participation in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was refused by the patient., Due to clinically predominant executive dysfunction and the described psychopathological symptoms, we considered bv-FTD as the most likely diagnosis.\nHowever, the neurological symptoms displayed by our patient could not sufficiently be explained by bv-FTD; therefore, an electroencephalogram was performed, which demonstrated a physiological alpha rhythm without signs of epileptiform potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed generalized cerebral atrophy with putaminal accentuation (putaminal rim sign), a hyperintensity at the lateral margin of the putamen, and ventriculomegaly (Figure ). A lumbar puncture with examination of CSF parameters including tau and beta-amyloid protein was unremarkable. Furthermore, intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and the presence of autoimmune encephalitis antibodies and protein 14–3–3 in CSF were excluded. Altogether, we suspected neurodegeneration as the underlying cause of all of the patient's symptoms including movement disturbances, symptoms of dementia, and psychiatric features.\nTo differentiate neurodegenerative disease patterns, cerebral glucose metabolism was investigated by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) which revealed global cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Glucose uptake was particularly low in the striatum, frontal inferior cortex (opercular part), cingulum, precuneus, hippocampus, and amygdala when compared to a control group of corresponding age. In contrast, glucose hypermetabolism could be observed in the occipital lobe (Figure ). Such a glucose metabolism pattern was evaluated unusual in pure dementia and pointed to a neurodegenerative disease with primary involvement of the basal ganglia. Of note, glucose hypometabolism in the striatum has been observed in atypical Parkinson syndromes, especially in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, and HD. This consideration led to genetic testing in order to determine the number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. People with fewer than 29 CAG repeats never develop HD, while the presence of 39 or more CAG repeats inevitably leads to the development of HD., In our patient, genetic testing revealed 42 CAG repeats in the HTT gene, confirming the diagnosis of HD.\nOver the course of inpatient care, the patient required support from the nursing staff for virtually all activities of daily living, including personal hygiene. Moreover, she was severely disoriented in both space and time. Therefore, the patient was assigned a legal guardian. Following discharge from our clinic, the patient was admitted to a residential home for patients with chronic psychiatric and neurological diseases.", "tokens": ["59", "year", "woman", "previous",

The first symptoms, according to her husband, began a year earlier in the form of memory problems, the patient quickly forgot new information, did not attend appointments, and had difficulties with everyday activities such as cooking (she often left the pot on the stove burning the food). The patient had been fired from her job several months earlier because she was unable to fulfil her responsibilities. Other than apathy, no other behavioural disturbances were observed. Her family history showed that her brother, 5 years older, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease several years earlier. The patient’s mother (who died at the age of 84) had suffered from dementia for 10 years. The results of the neurological examination were normal. The subject scored 23/30 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (she was not oriented to the month, date, lost 3 points when counting backwards and 2 when recalling words after distraction), and 10/10 on the Clock Drawing Test (CDT).\nOn follow-up examination, all laboratory results were normal. A CT scan of the brain (the patient did not consent to the MR scan due to claustrophobia) showed slight subcortical and cortical atrophy in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes ().\nThe neuropsychological profile of cognitive impairment showed episodic memory impairment and executive dysfunction. Molecular genetic analyses of the PSEN1, PSEN2, APP, APOE genes were performed by Sanger sequencing method. The patient had APOE3/3 genotype. A variant c.185G>A in one allele of PSEN2 gene was found. This variant was classified as benign/likely benign in ClinVar NCBI. In the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), the patient with sporadic AD carrying this variant was registered [CM981662]. The pathogenic role of the PSEN2 Arg62His mutation has not been demonstrated in a family with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where the variant was found in an asymptomatic mother and her symptomatic daughter, and the authors argued that other factors, including APOE genotype, may influence the onset of the disease in carriers of the variant []. The variant has been reported as a common variant in African populations [] and, after in vivo functional analysis, as a rare polymorphism with no effect on neurodegeneration []. On the other hand, this variant has also been shown to affect the stability of the protein, making it more susceptible to degeneration [].\nBased on the specific clinical phenotype (predominant executive function impairment, in addition to impairment of episodic memory in cognitive tests and the presence of apathy) and the results of genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with frontal variant Alzheimer’s disease [].", "tokens": ["59", "years", "woman", "cook", "presented", "outpatient", "clinic", "symptoms", "husband", "began", "year", "earlier", "form", "memory", "problems", "patient", "quickly", "forgot", "information", "attend", "appointments", "difficulties", "everyday", "activities", "cooking", "left", "pot", "stove", "burning", "food", "patient", "fired", "job", "months", "earlier", "unable", "fulfil", "responsibilities", "apathy", "behavioural", "disturbances", "observed", "family", "history", "showed", "brother", "5", "years", "older", "diagnosed", "alzheimer", "s", "disease", "years", "earlier", "patient", "s", "mother", "died", "age", "84", "suffered", "dementia", "10", "years", "results", "neurological", "examination", "normal", "subject", "scored", "23", "30", "mini", "mental", "state", "examination", "mmse", "oriented", "month", "date", "lost", "3", "points", "counting", "backwards", "2", "recalling", "words", "distraction", "10", "10", "clock", "drawing", "test", "cdt", "follow", "examination", "laboratory", "results", "normal", "ct", "scan", "brain", "patient", "consent", "mr", "scan", "due", "claustrophobia", "showed", "slight", "subcortical", "cortical", "atrophy", "frontal", "temporal", "occipital", "lobes", "neuropsychological", "profile", "cognitive", "impairment", "showed", "episodic", "memory", "impairment", "executive", "dysfunction", "molecular", "genetic", "analyses", "psen1", "psen2", "app", "apoe", "genes", "performed", "sanger", "sequencing", "method", "patient", "apoe3", "3", "genotype", "variant", "c", "185g", "allele", "psen2", "gene", "found", "variant", "classified", "benign", "benign", "clinvar", "ncbi", "human", "gene", "mutation", "database", "hgmd", "patient", "sporadic", "ad", "carrying", "variant", "registered", "cm981662", "pathogenic", "role", "psen2", "arg62his", "mutation", "demonstrated", "family", "frontotemporal", "dementia", "ftd", "variant", "found", "asymptomatic", "mother", "symptomatic", "daughter", "authors", "argued", "factors", "including", "apoe", "genotype", "influence", "onset", "disease", "carriers", "variant", "variant", "reported", "common", "variant", "african", "populations", "vivo", "functional", "analysis", "rare", "polymorphism", "effect", "neurodegeneration", "hand", "variant", "shown", "affect", "stability", "protein", "making", "susceptible", "degeneration", "based", "specific", "clinical", "phenotype", "predominant", "executive", "function", "impairment", "addition", "impairment", "episodic", "memory", "cognitive", "tests", "presence", "apathy", "results", "genetic", "testing", "patient", "diagnosed", "frontal", "variant", "alzheimer", "s", "disease"]}
{"_id": "8519172-1", "title": "", "text": "A 28-year-old male was admitted to the respiratory department of Jian'ou Hospital (Fujian, China) with repeated coughing and yellow phlegm in 2018. Family members complained that the patient had a history of ketamine abuse of about five to seven times monthly for 8 years. The last ketamine inhalation was the day before he was admitted to the hospital, according to a family member. During the past 5 years, he had been experiencing weakness of the lower limbs, numbness, sensory disorder, decreased muscle strength, difficulty climbing stairs, recurrent frequent urination and urgency and pain during urination. These symptoms persisted and were not significantly relieved by several conservative treatments but were worsened by repeated convulsions, aching in the hepatic region and jaundice 2 years ago. Then, he was diagnosed with “autoimmune hepatitis, chronic cholecystitis and cholangitis.” At that time, a craniocerebral computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a widened and deepened cerebral sulcus, the cerebral palsy became flattened, the ventricles expanded, the cerebellum was thickened, and brain volume decreased (). Electromyography revealed a central motor and sensory conduction disorder, and the motor nerve conduction velocity of bilateral tibial nerves was slower, indicating ketamine-related brain atrophy. His liver function normalised completely after dexamethasone treatment (15 mg for treatment and 5 mg for maintenance for more than 3 months). The patient planned to have cholecystectomy surgery 1 year later, but the operation was cancelled due to abnormal liver function and the development of renal failure. A CT examination revealed a constricted bladder with dilatation of the bilateral upper urinary tract, moderate hydronephrosis and medullary sponge kidney with multiple renal papillary calcifications. Subsequently, the patient's urine volume decreased gradually until he was not producing urine. He underwent haemodialysis treatment twice per week. After a sudden fall about 2 months before this hospitalisation, the patient was unable to walk and was confined to a wheelchair. He could not speak but made some slurred sounds, and he was conscious 2 weeks before admission.\nThe patient and his family members denied a history of cerebral disease or alcohol abuse. He was somnolent and jaundiced at admission. A physical examination revealed that muscle strength of both lower limbs was 0 and that of the upper limbs was 3. Routine blood testing revealed an increase in the number of leukocytes and a decrease in the number of erythrocytes. The haemoglobin value was 65 g/l. A faecal occult blood test was positive at 3+. His liver function tests (LFTs) were abnormal (serum bilirubin 283.3 mol/L, alkaline phosphatase 1,804 IU/L, alanine transaminase 19 IU/L, yGT 762 IU/L, and albumin 28.2 g/dL). Other blood tests revealed renal failure (urea 26.97 mmol/L and creatinine 375 μmol) and myocardial failure (NT-pro BNP >35,000 ng/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was tested three times, but the routine test, culture test, and syphilis test were all negative. A chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated pneumonia and bilateral kidney abnormalities. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly with regular pneumonia, blood transfusions and haemodialysis treatments.

He had a fever of 39.6 °C and a sore throat. His general condition was moderately severe; he was conscious, in logical contact, cachectic (body mass index: 15.59), and with severe dyspnoea. Vital signs were an average heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure 91/67 mmHg, tachypnea, with a respiratory rate of 44 breaths/min, oxygen saturation (spO2) on room air 76–89%, with an increase in spO2 up to 96% after oxygen therapy through a mask with a flow of 5 Lt/min. The medical history revealed smoking (more than 20 cigarettes/day) for most of his life. The patient was treated for tuberculosis in 1981.\nA test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a throat and nasal swab taken on 27 May 2020. The Vitassay qPCR SARS-CoV-2 test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral areas of confluent parenchymal and interstitial densities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper and middle fields. Computed tomography, completed on 28 May 2020, showed lesions typical of pulmonary tuberculosis (). Antimycobacterial treatment was initiated empirically in the following scheme: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB).\nFor further TB diagnosis, sputum was sampled from the patient and sent to the NRLT. The analysis of the fluorescent-stained microscopic smear using the Ziehl–Neelsen technique revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB+++) (A). The GeneXpert assay confirmed the presence of genetic material from MTBC. An identification and drug sensitivity test for the isolated strain confirmed it belonged to the species Mycobacterium tuberculosis and was sensitive to streptomycin (SM), INH, RMP, EMB, and PZA.\nFrom the third day of hospitalisation, respiratory failure was increasing, with no improvement after the use of high-flow oxygen therapy (helmet-based CPAP/continuous positive airway pressure).

{"_id": "8579522-1", "title": "", "text": "The patient was a woman in her fifties who sustained a head injury as a result of DV by her husband. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of our hospital. Her medical history included panic disorder and sleep disorder. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a right orbital floor fracture and sinusitis extending into the inferior of the orbit and into the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses (Fig. A). The orbital floor fracture was judged by a radiologist to be an old fracture. An emergency physician explained to the husband the need for her to get an eye checkup for ocular symptoms because of the old blowout fracture.\nForty-three days after the first visit to our hospital, she was hit again by the husband but continued to endure eye pain at home by using over-the-counter drugs, specifically analgesics, eye drops, and eye ointments. The sharp right eye pain and periorbital swelling gradually deteriorated, and pus began to appear from the right eye. Twenty-eight days following second violence, she accepted to undergo ophthalmological examination at our hospital. On presentation to us, the ocular surface of the right eye was covered with pus. Swelling of the upper and lower eyelids made eyelid closure impossible, and exophthalmos, severe corneal ulcer, panophthalmitis, and no light perception were observed (Fig. B). Although antianxiety and antipsychotic drugs were used under the direction of a psychiatrist as she started having a panic attack in the consultation room, ultrasonography and electroretinography could not be carried out. There was no obvious bruising around the eye and no tear on the ocular surface at that time. Head CT showed the old blowout fracture and chronic sinusitis as observed previously, but also orbital cellulitis and maxilla fracture that had not been previously detected. Orbital CT also showed that the shape of eyeball was maintained and that there was neither foreign body nor abscess in the orbit. It was noteworthy that there was no new blowout fracture. These findings raised concerns that orbital cellulitis could progress to intracranial infection unless intensive treatment was started. These potential risks were explained to her and the husband, but consent to immediate admission could not be obtained. She also strongly insisted on returning to the marital home and did so. Gram stain of pus sample obtained from the ocular surface showed gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, and gram-negative bacilli. In addition, Mitis. streptococcus and P. micra were isolated on anaerobic culture, with gamma-streptococci on aerobic culture.\nThe patient returned to our hospital at thirty-five days following second violence due to intolerable pain. As it seemed the topical and oral levofloxacin hydrate (Cravit®) had been ineffective, we recommended enucleation for the purposes of reducing the pain as quickly as possible and preventing orbital cellulitis from progressing to encephalitis. After obtaining her consent, surgical drainage and irrigation of the sinuses and enucleation were performed on the same day. Examination of the enucleated eyeball confirmed large abscess in the anterior chamber and infiltration of neutrophils into the interstitium of the cornea and conjunctiva (Fig. C). From this pathological result, we considered that orbital cellulitis had progressed to panophthalmitis. Gram stain of a pus sample from the maxillary paranasal sinus at surgical drainage yielded gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative bacilli, and leucocytes. Again, M. streptococcus and P. micra were isolated on anaerobic culture.\nPostoperatively, following intervention by the police and medical social workers, the psychiatrist proposed that the patient be transferred to the psychiatric hospital secretly and be kept under isolation from the husband. Nevertheless, she showed strong intention to return home with the husband and did so. After the pain resolved, she was referred to the department of plastic surgery at another university hospital to receive a prosthetic eye.", "tokens": ["patient", "woman", "fifties", "sustained", "head", "injury", "result", "dv", "husband", "transported", "ambulance", "emergency", "department", "hospital", "medical", "history", "included", "panic", "disorder", "sleep", "disorder", "computed", "tomography", "ct", "revealed", "orbital", "floor", "fracture", "sinusitis", "extending", "inferior", "orbit", "maxillary", "ethmoidal", "sinuses", "fig", "orbital", "floor", "fracture", "judged", "radiologist", "fracture", "emergency", "physician", "explained", "husband", "eye", "checkup", "ocular", "symptoms", "blowout", "fracture", "forty", "days", "visit", "hospital", "hit", "husband", "continued", "endure", "eye", "pain", "home", "counter", "drugs", "specifically", "analgesics", "eye", "drops", "eye", "ointments", "sharp", "eye", "pain", "periorbital", "swelling", "gradually", "deteriorated", "pus", "began", "eye", "twenty", "days", "violence", "accepted", "undergo", "ophthalmological", "examination", "hospital", "presentation", "ocular", "surface", "eye", "covered", "pus", "swelling", "upper", "lower", "eyelids", "made", "eyelid", "closure", "impossible", "exophthalmos", "severe", "corneal", "ulcer", "panophthalmitis", "light", "perception", "observed", "fig", "b", "antianxiety", "antipsychotic", "drugs", "direction", "psychiatrist", "started", "panic", "attack", "consultation", "room", "ultrasonography", "electroretinography", "carried", "obvious", "bruising", "eye", "tear", "ocular", "surface", "time", "head", "ct", "showed", "blowout", "fracture", "chronic", "sinusitis", "observed", "previously", "orbital", "cellulitis", "maxilla", "fracture", "previously", "detected", "orbital", "ct", "showed", "shape", "eyeball", "maintained", "foreign", "body", "abscess", "orbit", "noteworthy", "blowout", "fracture", "findings", "raised", "concerns", "orbital", "cellulitis", "progress", "intracranial", "infection", "intensive", "treatment", "started", "potential", "risks", "explained", "husband", "consent", "admission", "obtained", "strongly", "insisted", "returning", "marital", "home", "gram", "stain", "pus", "sample", "obtained", "ocular", "surface", "showed", "gram", "positive", "cocci", "gram", "positive", "bacilli", "gram", "negative", "bacilli", "addition", "mitis", "streptococcus", "p", "micra", "isolated", "anaerobic", "culture", "gamma", "streptococci", "aerobic", "culture", "patient", "returned", "hospital", "thirty", "days", "violence", "due", "intolerable", "pain", "topical", "oral", "levofloxacin", "hydrate", "cravit", "ineffective", "recommended", "enucleation", "purposes", "reducing", "pain", "quickly", "preventing", "orbital", "cellulitis", "progressing", "encephalitis", "obtaining", "consent", "surgical", "drainage", "irrigation", "sinuses", "enucleation", "performed", "day", "examination", "enucleated", "eyeball", "confirmed", "large", "abscess", "anterior", "chamber", "infiltration", "neutrophils", "interstitium", "cornea", "conjunctiva", "fig", "c", "pathological", "result", "considered", "orbital", "cellulitis", "progressed", "panophthalmitis", "gram", "stain", "pus", "sample", "maxillary", "paranasal", "sinus", "surgical", "drainage", "yielded", "gram", "positive", "cocci", "gram", "positive", "bacilli", "gram", "negative", "bacilli", "leucocytes", "m", "streptococcus", "p", "micra", "isolated", "anaerobic", "culture", "postoperatively", "intervention", "police", "medical", "social", "workers", "psychiatrist", "proposed", "patient", "transferred", "psychiatric", "hospital", "secretly", "isolation", "husband", "showed", "strong", "intention", "return", "home", "husband", "pain", "resolved", "referred", "department", "plastic", "surgery", "university", "hospital", "receive", "prosthetic", "eye"]}

{"_id": "8660594-1", "title": "", "text": "A 55kg, 11-year-old male underwent a right craniotomy and frontal lobectomy for resection of a seizure focus identified by prior intraoperative subdural EEG electrode grid application four days prior. The patient’s previous history was significant for pansinusitis complicated by right holohemispheric subdural empyema and thrombosis of the anterior third of the superior sagittal sinus in January 2019. This was treated with antibiotics and a right frontal craniotomy. In April of 2020, he developed seizures that were fulminant in presentation and rapidly became intractable. Seizure semiology included poor attention at school, body stiffening episodes, and periods of “spacing out.” The increase in seizure frequency had resulted in worsening academic performance (A to C student), blunting of effect, inability to continue with soccer, and impaired peer relationships. He was scheduled for right frontal lobe resection for focal, lesional epilepsy.\nOn the morning of surgery, he received his scheduled valproic acid and levetiracetam but experienced breakthrough seizure activity immediately prior to surgery. Therefore, he was transferred from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operative suite urgently. The patient was induced with rocuronium and propofol for endotracheal intubation. Maintenance included total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil infusions in order to accommodate the need for intraoperative neuromonitoring. The case proceeded uneventfully for 12 hours, and approximately one hour prior to the conclusion of surgery, the propofol and remifentanil infusions were discontinued. The total propofol dose throughout the case was approximately 2500 mg. Sevoflurane was initiated at 0.5 MAC in order to expedite emergence. Of note, these actions correlated with the conclusion of neuromonitoring and the beginning of dural closure. During the closure, the patient exhibited gross signs of full-body rigors. In the absence of neuromonitoring, seizure activity could not be confirmed or refuted by that diagnostic modality. At the request of the neurosurgeon, 2 mg of midazolam and 500 mg levetiracetam were given. Despite the cessation of all anesthetics for almost one hour, the patient failed to exhibit spontaneous respiratory effort or response to oral and tracheal suctioning. It also appeared that the patient had a downward gaze of his eyes, but pupillary reflexes were intact. He was brought directly from the operating room to CT to identify a possible post-surgical cause for his delayed emergence.\nCT revealed left to right midline shift into the surgical bed with diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation thought to reflect cerebral and cerebellar edema. The surgeon performed a bi-frontal craniotomy for reexploration based on these findings, which did not reveal a definitive cause. After the surgery, the skull fragment was not replaced in order to accommodate for swelling. The patient’s neurologist was consulted in the OR, and a loading dose of 1000 mg of intravenous fosphenytoin was recommended and administered. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout both anesthetics. The patient was transferred to the PICU with plans to maintain deep sedation, ICP monitoring, and continued aggressive seizure prophylaxis for at least 48 hours or until brain edema decreased. Results of an MRI without contrast obtained later that evening included “extensive cerebral and cerebellar edema without evidence for cytotoxic edema. The possibility of toxic or metabolic etiology is favored, florid posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) could also be considered”. The patient had an uneventful ICU course; no observed seizure activity, continuous negative EEG, normal neurologic exams, and was extubated on a postoperative day four after sedation with fentanyl and midazolam infusions weaned, and extubation criteria met. Upon discharge, a non-focal neurologic exam was elicited.

{"_id": "5039271-1", "title": "", "text": "A 68-year-old African American woman with well controlled type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was diagnosed with CLL (Rai stage III with negative CD38 and ZAP-70) in September 2012 when she presented with night sweats and 4.5 kg weight loss over the preceding eight months. She received six cycles of chlorambucil and prednisone over the following two years with partial response in her white blood cell count (WBC). Polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and lymphocytes ranged from 1.1 to 4.7 × 103/μL and 32 to 125 × 103/μL, respectively. In October 2014, she was started on ibrutinib 420 mg daily. In late November 2014, she was admitted for fever of 39.6°C and sore throat. After admission, she developed septic shock which was thought to be due to hospital acquired pneumonia and presumed Clostridium difficile colitis. Endotracheal culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida krusei. She required mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support with norepinephrine and vasopressin, chest tube placement, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). She recovered slowly and was discharged to a nursing home after two weeks of hospitalization. Ibrutinib was held during this hospitalization while PMN and lymphocytes ranged from 2.2 to 4.7 × 103/μL and 9.6 to 24.1 × 103/μL. One week after discharge, in December 2014, WBC increased to 67 × 103/μL; hence, ibrutinib was restarted. In January 2015, she presented with dry cough for one month and lower lip numbness for one hour. In the emergency department, she had no focal neurological deficit and CT brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial pathology; however, she had fever of 39.1°C, tachycardia, and tachypnea and was admitted. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation on ambient air were normal. Physical examination revealed expiratory wheezing in the right lower lung field; WBC on admission was 20.4 × 103/μL with 24% of neutrophil and 65% of lymphocyte. CT chest without contrast showed consolidation within the superior segment of the left lower lobe suggestive of pneumonia. She was started on empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and later transitioned to ceftazidime for presumed healthcare associated pneumonia, with gradual improvement of fever. Given patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics, no further diagnostic testing for pneumonia was performed. However after five days, one set of admission blood cultures grew yeast and oral fluconazole (800 mg load and then 400 mg daily) was initiated on the same day. She was later discharged to a nursing home on oral levofloxacin, clindamycin, and fluconazole pending identification of the yeast. Subsequently, the yeast blood isolate was identified as Cryptococcus neoformans. She was readmitted and underwent lumbar puncture after 8 days of fluconazole. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis was unremarkable with WBC of 1/μL, opening pressure was normal, and CSF and serum cryptococcal antigen were negative. Repeat blood cultures and CSF fungal culture were negative. Immunoglobulin G and M levels were low (immunoglobulin G level 558 mg/dL, reference range 594–1,618 mg/dL; immunoglobulin M level 47 mg/dL, reference range 77–220 mg/dL) but immunoglobulin A level was within normal range (333 mg/dL, reference range 68–378 mg/dL). CD4 lymphocyte count was not obtained. She received a 2-week course of induction therapy with liposomal amphotericin (3 mg/kg/day) and flucytosine for disseminated cryptococcal disease and was discharged on oral fluconazole 400 mg daily. Ibrutinib was restarted at lower dose given potential hepatic cytochrome P450 interaction with fluconazole.

{"_id": "5139711-1", "title": "", "text": "A 57-year-old woman applied to our gastroenterology outpatient-clinics with intermittent nausea and vomiting in August 1994. A sessile polypoid mass of 15 X 15 mm dimension was observed in prepyloric region during the endoscopic examination (). The patient refused polyp resection or biopsy at that time and 6 years later she had applied to the gastroenterology department for control. Later on she had four follow-up endoscopies between 2-year intervals. The polyp in prepyloric region persisted without any progression during this period. In the second biopsy the polyp was exulcerated under endoscopy and this finding was confirmed by histopathology.\nTotally, 12 biopsies were evaluated from the target lesion (3 biopsies from first, 4 biopsies from second, 2 biopsies from third, 3 biopsies from fourth endoscopy). In order to evaluate the progress of this polyp, we calculated the percentage of intestinal metaplastic component, the serrated component and also the intensity of mucin expression profile of each biopsy and took an average for each endoscopic biopsy set. Percentage of identifiable intestinal metaplastic component and serrated component for each biopsy material were calculated, so we were able to take an average for each biopsy. Goblet cells were accepted as the hallmarks of intestinal metaplasia. For immunohistochemical evaluation we calculated the percentage of immunoreactive mucosal component and took an average percentage for each biopsy.\nAn appropriate paraffin block was selected from four follow-up biopsies for immunohistochemical examination and a panel of MUC1 (E29 Neomarkers Fremont CA, USA), MUC2 (M53 Neomarkers Fremont CA, USA), MUC5AC (45M1 Neomarkers Fremont CA, USA), and MUC6 (MCN6.01 Neomarkers Fremont CA, USA) was applied. Histochemical stain of PAS-Alcian Blue Ph:2,5 was also applied to slides.\nIn microscopic examination, the first biopsy was composed of distorted and hyperplastic glandular structures with fibrovascular stroma. Intestinal metaplasia and a few glands composed of eosinophylic high columnar cells with slightly enlarged nucleus were observed and therefore lesion was diagnosed as hyperplastic polyp with intestinal metaplasia. Later in the second and third biopsy sets the glandular distortion and cellularity increased. In the last biopsy the polypoid mass had short villous proliferations composed of high columnar eosinophilic cells on the mucosal surface. The stroma was fibrotic and a few inflammatory cells were observed (). The component composed of crowded glands with large and oval nuclei, eosinophylic cytoplasm with distorted starry shaped glands increased progressively during the follow up biopsies () (). Mild cellular atypia was observed in a few cells in the third and fourth biopsy set. We counted goblet cells in ten-high power fields in their most frequently observed localizations. The number of goblet cells also decreased during the follow up. Surrounding gastric mucosa was detected in only 1 biopsy from the third endoscopy and there was chronic antral gastritis without Helicobacter Pylori colonization.\nIn PAS-Alcian Blue stain, eosinophilic columnar cells were stained purple and goblet cells were stained deep blue. PAS positive cells were decreased in surface epithelium during the follow-up. MUC1 immunoreactivity was observed in all cells. MUC 2 was observed commonly in goblet cells but also in non-goblet cells (), MUC5AC was observed more strongly in surface epithelium, but weakly in eosinophilic and goblet cells (). MUC6 was observed in all cell types. Co-expression of MUC1, 2, 5AC and 6 was observed frequently.\nThe number of biopsies, percentage of identifiable intestinal metaplastic component, serrated component and the immunoreactivity with MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6 are summarized in .", "tokens": ["57", "year", "woman", "applied", "gastroenterology", "outpatient", "clinics", "intermittent", "nausea", "vomiting", "august", "1994", "sessile", "polypoid", "mass", "15", "x", "15", "mm", "dimension", "observed", "prepyloric", "region", "endoscopic", "examination", "patient", "refused", "polyp", "resection", "biopsy", "time", "6", "years", "applied", "gastroenterology", "department", "control", "follow", "endoscopies", "2", "year", "intervals", "polyp", "prepyloric", "region", "persisted", "progression", "period", "biopsy", "polyp", "exulcerated", "endoscopy", "finding", "confirmed", "histopathology", "totally", "12", "biopsies", "evaluated", "target", "lesion", "3", "biopsies", "4", "biopsies", "2", "biopsies", "3", "biopsies", "fourth", "endoscopy", "order", "evaluate", "progress", "polyp", "calculated", "percentage", "intestinal", "metaplastic", "component", "serrated", "component", "intensity", "mucin", "expression", "profile", "biopsy", "average", "endoscopic", "biopsy", "set", "percentage", "identifiable", "intestinal", "metaplastic", "component", "serrated", "component", "biopsy", "material", "calculated", "average", "biopsy", "goblet", "cells", "accepted", "hallmarks", "intestinal", "metaplasia", "immunohistochemical", "evaluation", "calculated", "percentage", "immunoreactive", "mucosal", "component", "average", "percentage", "biopsy", "paraffin", "block", "selected", "follow", "biopsies", "immunohistochemical", "examination", "panel", "muc1", "e29", "neomarkers", "fremont", "ca", "usa", "muc2", "m53", "neomarkers", "fremont", "ca", "usa", "muc5ac", "45m1", "neomarkers", "fremont", "ca", "usa", "muc6", "mcn6", "01", "neomarkers", "fremont", "ca", "usa", "applied", "histochemical", "stain", "pas", "alcian", "blue", "ph", "2", "5", "applied", "slides", "microscopic", "examination", "biopsy", "composed", "distorted", "hyperplastic", "glandular", "structures", "fibrovascular", "stroma", "intestinal", "metaplasia", "glands", "composed", "eosinophylic", "high", "columnar", "cells", "slightly", "enlarged", "nucleus", "observed", "lesion", "diagnosed", "hyperplastic", "polyp", "intestinal", "metaplasia", "biopsy", "sets", "glandular", "distortion", "cellularity", "increased", "biopsy", "polypoid", "mass", "short", "villous", "proliferations", "composed", "high", "columnar", "eosinophilic", "cells", "mucosal", "surface", "stroma", "fibrotic", "inflammatory", "cells", "observed", "component", "composed", "crowded", "glands", "large", "oval", "nuclei", "eosinophylic", "cytoplasm", "distorted", "starry", "shaped", "glands", "increased", "progressively", "follow", "biopsies", "mild", "cellular", "atypia", "observed", "cells", "fourth", "biopsy", "set", "counted", "goblet", "cells", "ten", "high", "power", "fields", "frequently", "observed", "localizations", "number", "goblet", "cells", "decreased", "follow", "surrounding", "gastric", "mucosa", "detected", "1", "biopsy", "endoscopy", "chronic", "antral", "gastritis", "helicobacter", "pylori", "colonization", "pas", "alcian", "blue", "stain", "eosinophilic", "columnar", "cells", "stained", "purple", "goblet", "cells", "stained", "deep", "blue", "pas", "positive", "cells", "decreased", "surface", "epithelium", "follow", "muc1", "immunoreactivity", "observed", "cells", "muc", "2", "observed", "commonly", "goblet", "cells", "goblet", "cells", "muc5ac", "observed", "strongly", "surface", "epithelium", "weakly", "eosinophilic", "goblet", "cells", "muc6", "observed", "cell", "types", "expression", "muc1", "2", "5ac", "6", "observed", "frequently", "number", "biopsies", "percentage", "identifiable", "intestinal", "metaplastic", "component", "serrated", "component", "immunoreactivity", "muc1", "muc2", "muc5ac", "muc6", "summarized"]}

Cervical lymph nodes were noticed to be enlarged (Fig. ). With suspicion of granulomatous macrocheilitis; slit impression smear, culture and PCR were achieved. Just PCR was positive and characterized the parasite as L. infantum.\nThe studied patients were examined in the Dermatology Clinic of Saadi Hospital and Fajr Health Center from January 2014 to the end of December 2015. All patients were came from endemic regions of Fars province. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and therapeutic data from all patients.\nThe margin dermal scrapings were prepared with a no. 15 disposable sterile surgical blade (Unicut, Chicago, USA) to make a slit in the border of the lesion. Dermal tissues were stained with Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and exhibited amastigotes by light microscope. Employing Giemsa, amastigotes are seen within the cytoplasm of macrophages as pale blue oval bodies with a dark blue nucleus and a small rod-shaped kinetoplast with a specified mitochondrial frame that contains extra-nuclear DNA.\nIn addition, an aspirate from the active indurated margins of the same lesions was transferred to two tubes of the modified NNN culture medium. Modified NNN medium consists of two phases, horse blood agar base and an overlay Locke’s solution. The specimens were inoculated into the liquid phase of the biphasic medium and incubated. Positive cultures were run in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Frankfurt, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS (Gibco, Frankfurt, Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Frankfurt, Germany) for mass cultivation. Promastigotes were harvested and kept at -20 °C until used.\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from each clinical sample using the AccuPrep® Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quantification and quality control of the DNA extraction procedures were performed using a nano spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).

Standard PCR was carried out with 40 cycles, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C (for LINR4 and LIN17) or 58 °C (for LINR4 and LIN19), 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min in an Eppendorf thermal cycler (Hamburg, Germany). PCR products were visualized by UV after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel using TAE buffer and staining with GelRed (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). All primers were synthesized by Macrogen Genomics Laboratories (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). A 650-bp fragment was amplified for L. major, whereas a 760-bp and 720-bp fragments were amplified for L. tropica and L. infantum, respectively (Fig. ).\nThe PCR products were purified by using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced through the sequencing service of Macrogen Genomics Laboratories (Seoul, Korea).

{"_id": "5494397-1", "title": "", "text": "A 75-year-old man with NYHA-II class systolic heart failure due to hypertensive cardiomyopathy (history of long-lasting arterial hypertension, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with diffuse hypokinesia – LVEF = 40% in echocardiographic study and extreme coronary artery tortuosity without significant atheromatic disease in coronary angiography) underwent an ICD implantation in March 2013, after an episode of sustained VT with hemodynamic collapse, which required urgent cardioversion.\nSoon after the implantation, ES occurred with multiple episodes of sustained VT, requiring either antitachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock therapy for sinus rhythm restoration (Fig. ). Intravenous amiodarone was administered acutely, followed by chronic per os intake. New episodes of ES occurred during the following period, with no detectable triggering condition. Two transvenous ablation procedures were performed within 6 months, both without success. In both electrophysiological studies, ventricular stimulation was characterized by the induction of at least five different morphologies of sustained VT. During follow-up, three different high-dose b-blocker agents were administered consecutively (carvedilol, metoprolol, or bisoprolol in combination with amiodarone), as well as sotalol, with no clinical response. Mexiletine was added for a period of only 2 months. It was prematurely discontinued due to severe central nervous system toxicity.\nIn summary, during the period of 16 months after implantation, 211 appropriate ATP and 91 appropriate shocks occurred (Fig. ), despite our attempts to reduce shock burden, through adequate adjustment of therapy-zone parameters. More specifically, the lower limit of VT zone was gradually elevated from 136 beats per minute (bpm) tο 162 bpm (detection: 20 beats, redetection: 12 beats), as even long-lasting slow VT episodes were well tolerated, with no obvious hemodynamic deterioration. Additionally, the application of burst sequences (three sequences, 88%, 10 pulses) of VT zone was proven to be (more or less) ineffective. Thus, burst sequences were replaced by a more aggressive (and more effective) protocol of 3 plus 3 Ramp+ sequences (84%/78%/75%, eight pulses and 75%/69%/66%, eight pulses, respectively). In general, ATP and shocks were distributed normally in time, without long periods of recession. As a consequence, energy depletion of the device occurred prematurely (September 2014, device replacement). The heart rate spectrum of VTs was wide (120–230 bpm) and many episodes of sustained VT were only monitored without any intervention, displaying R-R interval above the therapy zones (heart rate 120–162 bpm, monitor-only zone). During this period, the patient underwent multiple hospitalizations, mainly receiving I.V. amiodarone. His quality of life clearly deteriorated, with new-onset symptoms of anxiety and depression (psychiatric consultation was also performed). Despite multiple shock therapies, four consecutive echocardiographic studies were fortunately comparable to the initial one, with no clear deterioration of left ventricular systolic function.\nAfter device replacement, new ES episodes occurred, as expected. The pattern of VTs and subsequent device interventions was somewhat different, with lower mean heart rate of VT episodes, many hundreds of ATP and only few shocks, always appropriate (Fig. ). Fifteen months after device replacement, subclinical hyperthyroidism was detected (December 2015, no previous history). Amiodarone was replaced by flecainide, with no clear clinical response (new episodes of VT occurred, with even lower mean heart rate, new therapeutic interventions – mainly ATP – were detected).\nThree months after amiodarone discontinuation, in March 2016, ranolazine was added to the antiarrhythmic therapy (patient under carvedilol 12.5 mg × 3 and flecainide 100 mg × 2), with up-titration to the dose of 750 mg × 2. Surprisingly, during the following 7 months (March to October 2016), no VT or VF episode occurred, in complete contrast to the displayed history of the previous 3 years, since first ICD implantation, with a total burden of 2871 ATP and 109 shocks, all appropriate (Fig. ). It should be mentioned that no reversible underlying arrhythmogenic conditions (other than cardiomyopathy) were ever detected in our patient. Additionally, the patient's adherence to medical advisory was reliable and constant during the long period of 3.5 years of follow-up. Currently, the patient is under a good psychologic and a stable functional status (NYHA-II).", "tokens": ["75", "year", "man", "nyha", "ii", "class", "systolic", "heart", "failure", "due", "hypertensive", "cardiomyopathy", "history", "long", "lasting", "arterial", "hypertension", "concentric", "left", "ventricular", "hypertrophy", "diffuse", "hypokinesia", "lvef", "40", "echocardiographic", "study", "extreme", "coronary", "artery", "tortuosity", "significant", "atheromatic", "disease", "coronary", "angiography", "underwent", "icd", "implantation", "march", "2013", "episode", "sustained", "vt", "hemodynamic", "collapse", "required", "urgent", "cardioversion", "implantation", "es", "occurred", "multiple", "episodes", "sustained", "vt", "requiring", "antitachycardia", "pacing", "atp", "shock", "therapy", "sinus", "rhythm", "restoration", "fig", "intravenous", "amiodarone", "administered", "acutely", "chronic", "os", "intake", "episodes", "es", "occurred", "period", "detectable", "triggering", "condition", "transvenous", "ablation", "procedures", "performed", "6", "months", "success", "electrophysiological", "studies", "ventricular", "stimulation", "characterized", "induction", "morphologies", "sustained", "vt", "follow", "high", "dose", "b", "blocker", "agents", "administered", "consecutively", "carvedilol", "metoprolol", "bisoprolol", "combination", "amiodarone", "sotalol", "clinical", "response", "mexiletine", "added", "period", "2", "months", "prematurely", "discontinued", "due", "severe", "central", "nervous", "system", "toxicity", "summary", "period", "16", "months", "implantation", "211", "atp", "91", "shocks", "occurred", "fig", "attempts", "reduce", "shock", "burden", "adequate", "adjustment", "therapy", "zone", "parameters", "specifically", "lower", "limit", "vt", "zone", "gradually", "elevated", "136", "beats", "minute", "bpm", "tο", "162", "bpm", "detection", "20", "beats", "redetection", "12", "beats", "long", "lasting", "slow", "vt", "episodes", "tolerated", "obvious", "hemodynamic", "deterioration", "additionally", "application", "burst", "sequences", "sequences", "88", "10", "pulses", "vt", "zone", "proven", "ineffective", "burst", "sequences", "replaced", "aggressive", "effective", "protocol", "3", "3", "ramp", "sequences", "84", "78", "75", "pulses", "75", "69", "66", "pulses", "general", "atp", "shocks", "distributed", "time", "long", "periods", "recession", "consequence", "energy", "depletion", "device", "occurred", "prematurely", "september", "2014", "device", "replacement", "heart", "rate", "spectrum", "vts", "wide", "120", "230", "bpm", "episodes", "sustained", "vt", "monitored", "intervention", "displaying", "r", "r", "interval", "therapy", "zones", "heart", "rate", "120", "162", "bpm", "monitor", "zone", "period", "patient", "underwent", "multiple", "hospitalizations", "receiving", "i", "v", "amiodarone", "quality", "life", "deteriorated", "onset", "symptoms", "anxiety", "depression", "psychiatric", "consultation", "performed", "multiple", "shock", "therapies", "consecutive", "echocardiographic", "studies", "fortunately", "comparable", "initial", "clear", "deterioration", "left", "ventricular", "systolic", "function", "device", "replacement", "es", "episodes", "occurred", "expected", "pattern", "vts", "subsequent", "device", "interventions", "lower", "heart", "rate", "vt", "episodes", "hundreds", "atp", "shocks", "fig", "fifteen", "months", "device", "replacement", "subclinical", "hyperthyroidism", "detected", "december", "2015", "previous", "history", "amiodarone", "replaced", "flecainide", "clear", "clinical", "response", "episodes", "vt", "occurred", "lower", "heart", "rate", "therapeutic", "interventions", "atp", "detected", "months", "amiodarone", "discontinuation", "march", "2016", "ranolazine", "added", "antiarrhythmic", "therapy", "patient", "carvedilol", "12", "5", "mg", "3", "flecainide", "100", "mg", "2", "titration", "dose", "750", "mg", "2", "surprisingly", "7", "months", "march", "october", "2016", "vt", "vf", "episode", "occurred", "complete", "contrast", "displayed", "history", "previous", "3", "years", "icd", "implantation", "total", "burden", "2871", "atp", "109", "shocks", "fig", "mentioned", "reversible", "underlying", "arrhythmogenic", "conditions", "cardiomyopathy", "detected", "patient", "additionally", "patient", "s", "adherence", "medical", "advisory", "reliable", "constant", "long", "period", "3", "5", "years", "follow", "patient", "good", "psychologic", "stable", "functional", "status", "nyha", "ii"]}
{"_id": "5494800-1", "title": "", "text": "A two-month-old male was brought to the Infectology service of INP to seek medical care, because he had dysmorphias. Also, maternal acute toxoplasmosis was suspected at six weeks of gestation (WG) due to abnormal evolution and presence of IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies (abs). The nineteen-year-old woman harbored intrauterine dichorionic diamniotic twins of 7.4 (gestational sac of 2.4 cm) and 7.3 (2.3 cm) WG as calculated from the ultrasound (USG) (Fig. ). She had miscarriage threat at 11 WG. At the 14th WG, only one apparently normal fetus was apparent in the USG, so there was involution of the other twin (Fig. ). A unilateral complete palatal defect was seen in the USG performed during the last trimester. A male product was born by cesarean at 38 WG; with a weight of 2.78 kg (P10), a height of 48 cm (P10–25), an Apgar score of 8/9 and a Silverman score of 0 points. The newborn lacked the left eye and presented ipsilateral oblique oro-orbital cleft. The diagnostic approach began four days after birth with a TORCH profile. IgG was positive for T. gondii, Rubella and Cytomegalovirus, but IgM abs were negative against the three agents. The blood count was normal. The baby presented bilateral sensorineural hearing loss as demonstrated by auditive screening. The metabolic screening results were normal.\nWhen the patient arrived to INP, no evidence of psychomotor retardation was found and the Ophthalmology service discarded alterations in the healthy eye. Cytomegalovirus and T. gondii infections were searched in blood by serology and real-time PCR. Congenital toxoplasmosis was confirmed by the presence of IgM abs and IgG neoabs in western blot, as well as by real time PCR in blood (Fig. ), with a parasite load of 6903 parasites/mL [, ].\nIn the cranial CT scan (Fig. ), the left oblique oro-orbital and parasagittal cleft defect were observed, as well as ipsilateral lack of osseous tissue and soft palate. Left choanal atresia and narrow-left vestibule were discovered in the nasal cavity. The right nasal cavity was communicated with the oropharynx through a narrow choanal passage. The left turbinates were hypoplastic. A nasal endoscopy was performed which confirmed CT scan findings. The left eyeball and the optic nerve were absent; however, hypoplastic extraocular muscles were present in the orbit. The brain parenchyma and the right side of the face were normal.\nAccording to the data described above, diagnosis was type 3 left craniofacial cleft (Tessier classification), ipsilateral anophthalmia and congenital toxoplasmosis.\nAnti-T. gondii therapy with pyrimethamine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and folinic acid was started according to the international recommendations []. At the beginning, the mother did not adhere to treatment, because as she argued, there was a long distance between her home and the hospital, but mainly because she had difficulty to understand the benefits of prophylactic chemotherapy; the physicians perseverated, so the second semester of life the baby received proper treatment.\nSurgical management was focused in maximizing actual vision and improving aesthetics, through simultaneous stimulation of soft tissues and bony orbital growth. Anophthalmia requires additional remodeling by soft tissue reconstruction and endo-orbital volume replacement (with implants, expanders and dermis-fat grafts). A first surgery was performed to start correction of the anatomical defect. During the surgery, a biopsy containing mucosa and skin was taken from the anophthalmia site. Images compatible with T. gondii pseudocysts and free parasites were observed by histopathology, as well as an active chronic inflammatory reaction, composed by lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and neutrophils (Fig. ).

The patient denied shortness of breath and previous episode of chest pain before admission. He had a past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension and was taking captopril. History of diabetes, smoking, and previous stroke or myocardial infarction was denied. On physical examination, blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, heart rate was 57x/minute, and respiratory rate was 20x/minute, and the cardiopulmonary examination was within normal limits.

{"_id": "5921440-1", "title": "", "text": "A 34-year-old man had reduced vision in his left eye for about 15 years, and night blindness for about two years. He had a complete ophthalmic examination including measurements of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examinations, indirect ophthalmoscopy, Goldmann perimetry (GP), perimetry with Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), MP-3 microperimetry, and full-field ERGs. His visual acuity was 20/15 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. The fundus did not show any obvious abnormalities, but optical coherence tomography showed partial loss of the interdigitation zone (Fig. ). The retinal sensitivity of the macular region was reduced in both eyes (Fig. ). His family ocular histories were unknown because both his parents and grandparents were dead.\nThe ERGs were recorded and analyzed with MEB-9402 (NIHON KOHDEN, Tokyo, Japan) and LS-100 (Mayo, Nagoya, Japan) as light emitting device. Before ERG recordings, we confirmed that the pupils were maximally dilated to approximately 8.0 mm following topical application of a mixture of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine (Sandol P; Nitten Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Aichi, Japan). ERG recordings performed binocularly with contact lens electrodes.\nHe was dark-adapted for 20 min, and the dark-adapted 0.01 ERG, dark-adapted 3.0 ERG, and dark-adapted oscillatory potentials were recorded in that order. The eye was then light-adapted for 10 min, and the light-adapted 3.0 ERG, light-adapted 30 Hz flicker (3.0 photopic cd‧s‧m− 2 stimulus luminance) were recorded. Then, ERGs elicited by long-duration stimuli (on and off responses: 63.0 cd/m2 stimulus intensity with 31.6 cd/m2 background intensity, 200 ms duration) were recorded. All of the recordings conformed to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard for full-field clinical electroretinography [].\nDuring the recording of the dark-adapted ERG series elicited by single flashes, there were no changes in the patient’s overall condition. However, as soon as the flicker ERG recordings were completed and long-duration flashes began, the patient reported that a paralysis had developed in both upper limbs. Therefore, the examiner immediately stopped the ERG recordings, and soon thereafter, convulsions of the lower limbs developed and he lost consciousness. The convulsions disappeared after an intravenous injection of diazepam. Examinations of the ERG recordings, no apparent decrease in amplitudes or extension of implicit times were observed as compared with the normal waveforms indicated by ISCEV. No abnormality of the a-wave / b-wave ratio at the maximum combined response was observed (Fig. ). Computed tomography of the head was performed on the same day, and no abnormality was found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was also performed later, and the findings were normal. There was no abnormality in the electroencephalogram examination performed after the attack.

{"_id": "5965207-1", "title": "", "text": "An 88-year-old Caucasian male presented to our ED by ambulance after being found unresponsive on the floor of his home by family. On arrival he was pale and mottled, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3. He was normothermic, tachycardic in sinus rhythm, hypertensive, and severely hypoxic. Traumatic injuries on exam were significant for large anterior chest wall contusion, right leg laceration, and inwardly rotated legs of equal length with symmetric hips. Peripheral pulses were 1+ palpable. The patient was intubated in upright positioning due to oxygen desaturations while lying flat. An orogastric tube drained coffee-ground fluid and a urethral catheter initial efflux was clear yellow and then transitioned to gross hematuria. The patient’s initial labs were significant for influenza A, acute kidney injury, ischemic hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis, lactic acidemia, non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and a negative comprehensive drug screen. His family arrived later and provided additional history. He had been a healthy, independent octogenarian who played tennis weekly, had no medical problems, and took no prescription medications. In the week prior to the incident, the patient exhibited flu-like symptoms but sounded well on the phone one day prior to presentation. When they found him unresponsive, he was not found near stairs.\nComputed tomography revealed bilateral posterior hip dislocations with both femoral heads superior and posterior to the acetabulum ( and ). There were no pelvic fractures. Bilateral closed hip reduction was performed at the bedside using the Allis reduction maneuver. With the hip stabilized by an assistant, traction was applied to the femur with the knee in flexion, as the hip was slowly flexed to 90 degrees. An obvious “clunk” occurred as the femoral head slid back into the acetabulum. The hip was then slowly extended maintaining traction and the leg positioned in abduction and external rotation while post-reduction films were obtained. There was concern for right hip instability because the patient required multiple right hip reductions, including axial traction as described above, and modified Allis maneuver without knee flexion. The left hip was reduced easily with axial traction. Both legs were placed in knee immobilizers and positioned in hip abduction and flexion. Reduction was confirmed with AP pelvis radiograph (). Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were palpable before and after the reduction. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nThe patient was awake and following commands while intubated on ICU day 1, and was extubated on ICU day 10. His only neurologic deficit was mild difficulty with concentration. On follow-up, patient recalled that he was standing on a level surface and reaching for a glass of water when he lost balance and fell with his legs “doing the splits.” He denied head trauma or loss of consciousness with his fall. He was unable to call for help despite dragging himself across the floor, and he lay on the ground for approximately 30 hours. He had never sustained prior hip injury or dislocation. On ICU day 9, orthopedic surgery performed an exam under anesthesia and found no joint instability. Later, he developed decreased sensation in the right leg attributed to sciatic neuropraxia. His hospital course was complicated by multisystem organ failure requiring initiation of dialysis, possible aspiration pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, metabolic encephalopathy, and hematochezia with acute blood loss anemia.

However, in the ICU, the patient was maintained under regular and continuous monitoring of vital and neurological signs and level of consciousness. The day after admission, the patient’s headache had completely resolved. The patient was admitted to the ICU for 5 days and was monitored for volume ofpneumocephalus every day with a CT scan. At the end of 5 days, the patient's pneumocephalus was resolved completely, and she was transferred to the ward.

{"_id": "4086693-1", "title": "", "text": "A 56-year-old African American man who initially presented with diarrhea, weight loss and painless jaundice, was subsequently found to have adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas. An initial workup revealed localized cancer with no evidence of distant metastases. He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete surgical resection of a 5cm moderately differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although our patient underwent complete surgical resection, a pathological examination revealed a neoplastic invasion of the resected adjacent organs, and one out of the seven resected lymph nodes contained cancer (T3N1M0). At that point, the oncology department recommended to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 on a 28-day cycle for six cycles) to try to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.\nHowever, after completing two cycles (a total of six doses) of chemotherapy, he presented to the emergency department with worsening exertional dyspnea, three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue. His physical examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) (10cm above the sternal angle), bibasilar rales and +2 pitting edema of both lower extremities. Cardiac auscultation revealed a gallop rhythm with an S3 and a grade 3 holosystolic murmur over precordium. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with mild to moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. It was thought that his presentation was consistent with fluid overload secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and he was started on intravenous (IV) furosemide with partial improvement in his symptoms.\nThe next day, a two-dimensional echocardiography (2D Echo) was performed, which showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15 to 20 percent with global hypokinesia along with moderate mitral regurgitation. Given the findings of 2D Echo and the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP), it was concluded that our patient’s CMP was related to the recent use of gemcitabine. Our patient was then started on carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to diuretics and he was discharged from the hospital two days later in a euvolemic state.\nAt that point, the cardiology department recommended stopping further chemotherapy with gemcitabine. The oncology department advised further testing to rule out ischemia as a cause of CMP as, in their opinion, chemotherapy with gemcitabine was the only option to reduce the risk of recurrence in this patient. Two weeks later, our patient underwent myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which showed a fixed small- to moderate-sized inferior wall defect without any evidence of active ischemia. The ejection fraction (EF) on MPI was calculated to be around 17 to 20 percent with severe global hypokinesia. Our patient was continued on standard heart failure therapy with one more admission to the hospital for CHF exacerbation about two months later. He responded well to IV furosemide and adjustment of heart failure therapy. A 2D Echo was repeated a few months later and it showed improvement in systolic function with an LVEF of 40 percent.\nDue to his poor functional status and underlying CMP, further gemcitabine chemotherapy was stopped. Later, our patient developed a recurrence of his pancreatic cancer; he refused further chemotherapy and decided to proceed with palliative care.\nAlthough the exact etiology of our patient’s dilated cardiomyopathy remains unclear, gemcitabine remains the most likely culprit. The temporal relationship of his symptoms to the initiation of gemcitabine chemotherapy; the lack of risk factors for ischemic CMP and prior history of CAD, finding of global hypokinesia on 2D Echo, absence of ischemia on MPI; and improvement in his systolic function after discontinuation of gemcitabine were all consistent with gemcitabine-induced cardiomyopathy.", "tokens": ["56", "year", "african", "american", "man", "initially", "presented", "diarrhea", "weight", "loss", "painless", "jaundice", "subsequently", "found", "adenocarcinoma", "head", "pancreas", "initial", "workup", "revealed", "localized", "cancer", "evidence", "distant", "metastases", "underwent", "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "complete", "surgical", "resection", "5cm", "moderately", "differentiated", "pancreatic", "adenocarcinoma", "patient", "underwent", "complete", "surgical", "resection", "pathological", "examination", "revealed", "neoplastic", "invasion", "resected", "adjacent", "organs", "resected", "lymph", "nodes", "contained", "cancer", "t3n1m0", "point", "oncology", "department", "recommended", "proceed", "adjuvant", "chemotherapy", "gemcitabine", "1000mg", "m2", "iv", "days", "1", "8", "15", "28", "day", "cycle", "cycles", "reduce", "likelihood", "recurrence", "completing", "cycles", "total", "doses", "chemotherapy", "presented", "emergency", "department", "worsening", "exertional", "dyspnea", "pillow", "orthopnea", "paroxysmal", "nocturnal", "dyspnea", "fatigue", "physical", "examination", "revealed", "elevated", "jugular", "venous", "pressure", "jvp", "10cm", "sternal", "angle", "bibasilar", "rales", "2", "pitting", "edema", "lower", "extremities", "cardiac", "auscultation", "revealed", "gallop", "rhythm", "s3", "grade", "3", "holosystolic", "murmur", "precordium", "chest", "x", "ray", "showed", "cardiomegaly", "mild", "moderate", "sized", "sided", "pleural", "effusion", "thought", "presentation", "consistent", "fluid", "overload", "secondary", "congestive", "heart", "failure", "chf", "started", "intravenous", "iv", "furosemide", "partial", "improvement", "symptoms", "day", "dimensional", "echocardiography", "2d", "echo", "performed", "showed", "left", "ventricular", "ejection", "fraction", "lvef", "15", "20", "percent", "global", "hypokinesia", "moderate", "mitral", "regurgitation", "findings", "2d", "echo", "absence", "significant", "risk", "factors", "coronary", "artery", "disease", "cad", "ischemic", "cardiomyopathy", "cmp", "concluded", "patient", "s", "cmp", "related", "recent", "gemcitabine", "patient", "started", "carvedilol", "angiotensin", "converting", "enzyme", "inhibitor", "addition", "diuretics", "discharged", "hospital", "days", "euvolemic", "state", "point", "cardiology", "department", "recommended", "stopping", "chemotherapy", "gemcitabine", "oncology", "department", "advised", "testing", "rule", "ischemia", "cmp", "opinion", "chemotherapy", "gemcitabine", "option", "reduce", "risk", "recurrence", "patient", "weeks", "patient", "underwent", "myocardial", "perfusion", "imaging", "mpi", "showed", "fixed", "small", "moderate", "sized", "inferior", "wall", "defect", "evidence", "active", "ischemia", "ejection", "fraction", "ef", "mpi", "calculated", "17", "20", "percent", "severe", "global", "hypokinesia", "patient", "continued", "standard", "heart", "failure", "therapy", "admission", "hospital", "chf", "exacerbation", "months", "responded", "iv", "furosemide", "adjustment", "heart", "failure", "therapy", "2d", "echo", "repeated", "months", "showed", "improvement", "systolic", "function", "lvef", "40", "percent", "due", "poor", "functional", "status", "underlying", "cmp", "gemcitabine", "chemotherapy", "stopped", "patient", "developed", "recurrence", "pancreatic", "cancer", "refused", "chemotherapy", "decided", "proceed", "palliative", "care", "exact", "etiology", "patient", "s", "dilated", "cardiomyopathy", "remains", "unclear", "gemcitabine", "remains", "culprit", "temporal", "relationship", "symptoms", "initiation", "gemcitabine", "chemotherapy", "lack", "risk", "factors", "ischemic", "cmp", "prior", "history", "cad", "finding", "global", "hypokinesia", "2d", "echo", "absence", "ischemia", "mpi", "improvement", "systolic", "function", "discontinuation", "gemcitabine", "consistent", "gemcitabine", "induced", "cardiomyopathy"]}
{"_id": "4164124-1", "title": "", "text": "A 29-year-old gravida 2 para 1 Caucasian female was referred for maternal-fetal-medicine consultation at 26-week gestation due to suspected fetal anomalies. Obstetrical ultrasound examination, confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demonstrated craniofacial duplication, several abnormalities of the brain and skull, thoracolumbosacral dysraphism with neural tube defect and likely Chiari II malformation, large congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) with liver and bowel noted in the left chest, hypoplastic left lung, and possible horseshoe kidney (). Fetal echocardiogram findings were consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The parents had a multidisciplinary consultation with maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, genetics, cardiology, radiology, and palliative care. Given the multiple, severe congenital anomalies, the medical team and family planned for limited resuscitative efforts and anticipated comfort care after birth.\nA 2440 g male infant was delivered via repeat cesarean section at 36-week gestation secondary to preterm labor. At birth, the infant was pale and cyanotic with no spontaneous cry and poor tone. He had shallow spontaneous respirations with poor aeration on auscultation. The left mouth was small and fixed. No glottis was visualized when the laryngoscope was inserted into the right mouth. The infant was then wrapped in a warm blanket and given to the family to hold. He died in his parents' arms a few minutes after birth.\nThe parents consented to a complete postmortem evaluation. Physical exam demonstrated complete facial duplication with tetrophthalmos (four eyes), two noses, two mouths, two chins, and one fully formed ear on each side of the head with a hypoplastic pinna in the midline. Two anterior and two posterior fontanels were palpable. There was also a ruptured myelomeningocele measuring 6.3 cm × 3.9 cm in the thoracolumbar region and a scaphoid abdomen. The first and second toes of each foot overlapped and the nails were hypoplastic.\nDissection of the cranial cavity revealed brain duplication with fusion of the parietal and occipital lobes of each brain. The right and left brains fused at the mesencephalon and brainstem. Each brain had an optic chiasm, a pituitary gland, and a single large ventricle with loss of the ependymal lining and no third ventricle identified. There was a single midbrain, rudimentary cerebellar tissue and fourth ventricle, atresia of the cerebral aqueduct with rudimentary and hypoplastic cerebral peduncles, bilateral absence of the corpus callosum, bilateral polymicrogyria, and dysplasia of the right and left cortices. Dissection of the thorax and abdomen revealed left CDH with intestine, stomach, spleen, and the left lobe of the liver herniated into the left pleural cavity with concomitant pulmonary hypoplasia. Cardiac findings included TOF (pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and pulmonary arteries), atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, superior pulmonary veins draining to the left atrium (no inferior pulmonary veins), dilated right atrium, and hypoplastic left atrium. A common oropharynx connected two separate nasopharynxes and two separate oral cavities. There was a single larynx and esophagus. The intestines were malrotated with the appendix located in the left upper abdominal quadrant. Ectopic right and left kidneys were located in the lower abdomen and an accessory spleen was present. Testes were undescended bilaterally and the right testis was atrophic. The placental pathology revealed normal fetal membranes and chorionic villi consistent with third trimester gestation with a two-vessel umbilical cord ().\nWhole-genome microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using Oxford Gene Technology revealed a male karyotype (46 X,Y), a 983 kb deletion on chromosome 4q34.3, a 562 kb gain on chromosome Xp22.31p22.2, and a 32 kb gain on chromosome 13q12.11. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of maternal blood indicated the duplications on chromosomes Xp22.31p22.2 and 13q12.11 were maternally inherited. The 4q34.3 deletion was not maternally inherited, however.

White blood cell count was 19,500 cells/mm3 with 92.8% neutrophils.\nThe sonographic examination did not reveal any findings consistent with acute appendicitis exception for periceaceal fluid and it showed a normal intrauterine pregnancy. With a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a laparotomy was done via a paramedian incision in the right side of the abdomen. Appendix was erythematous and appendicectomy was performed.\nThe histopathological examination of the appendix revealed acute appendicitis with extensive deciduosis of the appendiceal wall of all the three layers. There were also glandular structures among the decidua which were positive with cytokeratin 7, while the adjacent appendicial mucosa was negative. The diagnosis was endometriosis and decidiosis of appendix and acute appendicitis.

{"_id": "4166645-1", "title": "", "text": "In August 2012, a 47-year-old, white Caucasian, female patient was referred, by an orthodontist, to the Stomatology Department of the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná, Brazil, presenting with extreme signs of local pain in the submandibular region and speaking limitations due to hampered mouth opening. Clinically, left submandibular lymphadenopathy was detected, as well as edema in the left side of the floor of the mouth, with a purulent discharge. In addition, a yellowish structure of hard consistency was observed near to the sublingual caruncle. An occlusal radiograph revealed a cylindrical radiopaque sialolith-compatible image, measuring approximately 2 × 1 cm, in the lower left canine region, confirming the diagnosis of submandibular sialolithiasis ().\nDuring the anamnesis, the patient did not report systemic diseases and reported being allergic to Penicillin. Further, the surgical excision was executed in the same day due to the exacerbated symptoms and the favorable position, in which the sialolith took place after a submandibular massage. Under local anesthesia, a 5 mm incision was performed on the mucosa, over the sialolith. In order to move the sialolith close to the incision, the submandibular massage in the posteroanterior direction was repeated. Using forceps, a 20 mm sialolith () was removed from the floor of the mouth. After the sialolith removal, it was possible to see the reinstatement of salivary flow and also the reduction of the purulent discharge. The patient was medicated with Azithromycin 500 mg, Ibuprofen 600 mg, and Paracetamol 750 mg.\nIn the following week, the patient returned without edema and local inflammation. The submandibular gland function was tested performing local massage, indicating normal salivary flow. Surprisingly, the patient provided a previous panoramic radiograph, dating from March 2011 (), representing the last radiographic exam for conclusion of orthodontic treatment. Despite slight morphological alteration, the orthodontic radiograph allowed for the detection of the sialolith. Based on the lack of early detecting the sialolith on the orthodontic radiograph, a deeper investigation in the patient's dental files was carried out revealing an additional panoramic radiograph, dating from June 2004, in which no sign of sialolith was detected ().

{"_id": "4320463-1", "title": "", "text": "26-year old female patient underwent surgery of a cleft palate at the age of 5 years, later she had no significant health issue. Melorheostosis was diagnosed incidentally by X-ray after shoulder injury in sport.\nClinical examination showed reduced joint abduction 60 degress in the shoulder, further movement was possible only in scapula, movement range in the elbow was limited to 20 degrees, in radiocarpal joint was volar flexion up to 40 degrees, dorsal flexion 0, pronation and supination was also 0. The patient reported pain in the whole upper limb at rest. Osteopoikilotic islands were identified in the body of third cervical vertebra and also in the right collar bone and sternum manubrium. CT of the upper limbs and upper chest was performed without contrast tracer. There was no family history of melorheostosis found.\nDiffuse thickening and sclerotisation was identified on index finger, II. metacarp shaft on the left hand, the lesion was less aparent at the I. metacarp of the left hand and on some carpal bones (Figure ). There was diffusely enlarged sclerotic radius, humerus and the scapula on the left side. The cavities on affected bones were completely filled with the sclerotic bone. Small sclerotic focus was in the ventral part of C3 vertebral body - size 7 mm (Figure ), there was also a small island in the left manubrium sternum and in the sternal part of the left collarbone. The finding corresponded to melorheostosis Léri. Thickness of patient’s left scapula was up to 31 mm, the contralateral scapula was unaffected with thickness of 2–3 mm. The cortex of both collarbone and ribs had slightly higher bone density. The skull was without pathological finding.\nBone scintigraphy showed normal level of overall metabolic activity in the skeleton. Significant, locally inhomogeneous increase of activity was evident in most of the scapula, humerus, radius and in II. shaft on the left, the highest intensity of changes was in the scapula, which showed 7-times higher activity compared to the contra lateral parts. Activity increase in the I. shaft left was more modest and slight accumulation was present in the left medial clavicle (Figure ). The rest of skeleton was without significant pathological changes.\nDXA examination of the whole skeleton showed osteopenia in the lumbar spine: T score −1.2 SD, in both hips T-score was same and within the normal range. There was no abnormality found in the laboratory tests including bone markers except for increased level of osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide.\nThe published cases reported good experience with bisphosphonate in terms of disease progression []. The patient was treated with weekly alendronate and COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib). In connection with the development of sleep disorders and increased skin sensitivity sensitivity on affected site naftidrofuryl in high doses (600 mg daily) was added, which led to symptoms relieve. The patient is currently without pain and is able to perform normal daily activities with non-progressive restriction for 5 years after the diagnosis. Pharmacological treatment in described combination could delay surgery solution and eventually could prevent an excessive dosage of analgetics.

{"_id": "4395622-1", "title": "", "text": "A 46-year-old Caucasian woman complained of constant right eye tearing for 6 months, and it had worsened to cause blurry vision and interfered with wearing contact lens. She had intermittent pressure pain in the right medial canthus that improved after treatment with tobramycin-dexamethasone drops. Past history included deviated septum, anxiety, mitral valve prolapse, and venous insufficiency of the legs, and her medications were calcium and multi-vitamins. Visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Confrontation visual fields, extraocular motility, and pupillary exam were normal. The intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in each eye. Pooling of clear tears was noted on a normal-appearing right lower lid without an enlarged, erythematous, or tender lacrimal sac. Nasolacrimal dilation and irrigation revealed complete reflux of clear saline, and the remainder of the ocular exam was unremarkable.\nThe patient underwent an uneventful external dacryocystorhinostomy with placement of Crawford stent. Milky purulent material, found upon entering the lacrimal sac, was sent for Gram stain and culture. The Gram stain showed Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters and pleomorphic coccobacilli (Figure A). The patient was discharged with oral cephalexin 250 mg four times daily for 5 days along with erythromycin ointment and tobramycin-dexamethasone drops. Routine cultures initially revealed suspected Granulicatella/Abiotrophia species based on biochemical phenotype, good growth on chocolate agar, and colony satellitosis on sheep blood agar within beta-hemolysis zones of co-inoculated Staphylococcus aureus (Figure B,C,D).

{"_id": "4808524-1", "title": "", "text": "A 37-year-old African-American male with past medical history of HIV (detected in 2001; transmitted by heterosexual intercourse; latest CD4 count 320 cells/mm3 with undetectable viral load; compliant with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); no opportunistic infections in past) and nephrolithiasis presented to emergency department of our hospital with progressively worsening epigastric pain and nausea for one week. Pain was constant and was rated severe and radiated to his back. The patient denied hematemesis, hematochezia, or diarrhea. However, he reported weight loss of 12 lbs in last 2 months but denied night sweats. There was no history of recent travel, sick contacts, or illicit drug use. Vital signs were notable for tachycardia of 120 beats/minute and low-grade fever of 38.8°C. The physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness with no rebound. Initial laboratory evaluation showed elevated levels of lipase 629 IU/L (33–200), amylase 250 IU/L (30–110), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 936 IU/L (313–618), and C-reactive protein 3.6 mg/dL (0-1), with normal liver and renal function tests. White cell count was 3.8 × 109cells/L (3.8–9.8 × 109), hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL (13.5 to 17.5), and platelets were 139 × 109 cells/L (150–450 × 109). Cardiac troponins came out negative with unchanged EKG. Preliminary diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made. Subsequently, abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated multiple, well-defined, peripancreatic, soft tissue masses to left of the uncinate process (), posterior to the pancreatic tail, and near the hepatic hilum (). The peripancreatic masses were found to be compressing the body of pancreas, causing acute pancreatitis in our patient. Furthermore, there was partial compression of the portal vein with multiple surrounding portal venous system collaterals.\nDifferential diagnoses included lymphoma, mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), disseminated fungal infection, and tuberculosis (TB). The case was discussed in the multidisciplinary tumor board. It was concluded that, due to the advanced disease, tissue diagnosis will be difficult employing surgery or interventional radiology. Thereafter, an uneventful endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of one of the masses was performed, and preliminary pathology suggested lymphoma. Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and serotonin levels were within normal limits. Sputum AFB culture and QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) were negative ruling out TB. Fungal cultures and isolated bacterial cultures for MAC also came out negative. Total body scan showed subcentimeter bilateral mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy. Histopathology analysis revealed diffused infiltration of large B-cells with plasmablastic (cells with rounded nuclei, coarser chromatin, and smaller two to three nucleoli) and immunoblastic morphological features (cells with vesicular enlarged nuclei and single prominent nucleolus). A high proliferative index with frequent apoptosis and focal necrosis was demonstrated. Immunohistochemistry of the peripancreatic specimen revealed neoplastic cells positive for BOB1, MUM1, and EBER-ISH, partially positive for CD79a, and negative for CD20, CD56, CD138, CD3, CD5, AE1/AE3, and HHV8, most consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy was performed for staging purposes. It revealed normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with no evidence of excess blasts or lymphoma. Furthermore, lumber puncture cytology was negative for malignant cells and CSF flow cytometry did not show any abnormal cells; based on these findings, the patient was deemed as stage III.\nSubsequently, epigastric pain improved with oral opioids and other pancreatitis-related symptoms resolved with the symptomatic treatment. The patient was discharged from the hospital with oncology out-patient follow-up. Therein, he was initiated on cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy. Central nervous system prophylaxis was achieved by employing intrathecal chemotherapy. Filgrastim (G-CSF) was administered twenty-four hours after CHOP cycles and was continued daily for seven days. Our patient tolerated the treatment well, with no significant interactions with HAART for his HIV-infection, and achieved remission after six cycles of chemotherapy. Contrast-enhanced CT at the level of pancreas 3 months after initiation of CHOP treatment demonstrated near complete resolution of previously seen soft tissue masses ().

{"_id": "4834819-1", "title": "", "text": "A 48-year-old male police officer was referred to a chiropractic clinic by a general practitioner for the evaluation of acute low back pain (LBP) of two weeks duration. The patient reported that the LBP had come on after spending a 12-h night shift driving a patrol car. The LBP was described as diffuse and the patient reported sharp pain radiating down the left lateral thigh to the knee. The average pain intensity was rated as 6/10 on a visual analogue scale (VAS), but had progressed to 8/10 VAS at the time of presentation. The symptoms were aggravated by sitting, sleeping on the left side, and inactivity; while standing provided the most relief. The pain was worse in the morning, and improved only marginally during the day. Self-care with heat packs and over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6 × 200 mg ibuprofen tablets per day) provided only a 2-point reduction on the VAS. The patient denied the presence of any paraesthesia (e.g. pins or needles), saddle anaesthesia, loss or changes in bladder or bowel control, fever, or nocturnal pain. The patient reported an approximately 20 kg reduction in body weight over the past 10 months, which he attributed to dietary changes and uptake of a substantial exercise regimen.\nThe patient also complained of left-sided headaches in the suboccipital and temporal regions of three weeks duration. The headaches were accompanied by occasional dizziness (clarified to be a feeling of unease) that were aggravated by sustained awkward neck postures. He had a family history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and migraines. His grandmother had passed away from bowel cancer. The patient was currently being treated for haemochromotosis, for which he had been managed successfully for 8 years. The rest of the systems review was unremarkable.\nThe physical examination revealed a marked antalgic posture to the right with limited active lumbar range of motion (ROM) in left lateral flexion and flexion (finger-to-floor reach was noted to be 2 cm above the knees). Coughing, sneezing, and Valsalva manoeuvre reproduced the LBP, but not the leg pain. Straight leg raise was positive for leg and back pain at 40° on the left and negative at 70° on the right. Bragard’s test was positive on the left, while slump test and well leg raise were negative. Deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+) in both upper and lower limbs, except for the patella reflex on the left which was slightly diminished (1+). There was no decreased sensation to pin prick or vibration sense in either the upper or lower limbs; however, sensation to light touch was slightly decreased in the left L4 dermatome. Motor and cranial nerve exams were unremarkable. Blood pressure was 152/92 mmHg and the resting heart rate was 75 bpm (measured in the sitting position).\nThe left temporal headache and dizziness (uneasiness) could be reproduced by combined flexion and 25° of rotation of the head to the right. The same manoeuvre on the contralateral side was pain free at 50° of rotation. There was marked tenderness to palpation over the left C2/3 zygapophysial joint and the lumbar spinous processes.\nOn the basis of the clinical presentation, history, and findings of the physical examination, a working diagnosis of posterolateral L3/4 intervertebral disc herniation affecting the left L4 nerve root was made, and a trial of conservative management was suggested to the patient. The patient also received a concurrent working diagnosis of cervicogenic headache. In addition, the patient was recommended to seek further evaluation of his blood pressure.\nConservative management consisted of cryotherapy (ice packs), high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation to the lumbar region, isometric stretching, and neurodynamic mobilisation techniques (neural flossing). This passive care was complemented by ergonomic advice and a prescribed back extension exercise program. The patient received a total of 6 treatments over a 4-week period. After this treatment regimen the patient reported the LBP to be 1-2/10 VAS, with no pain radiating down the left leg, and that he was able to perform all activities of daily living. Neurodynamic tension tests (e.g. straight leg raise and Bragard’s test) were negative. Lumbar spine ROM was improved (finger-to-floor reach 34 cm below the knees during flexion) and pain free.\nThe patient was discharged with a 4-week core muscle strengthening program and asked to return for a follow-up consultation after its completion, or earlier if symptoms returned. The patient returned asymptomatic after 4 weeks, and was able to satisfactorily perform the functional core strength tests.\nTwo months after the last follow-up of the first episode of LBP, the patient presented to the chiropractic clinic with a new episode of acute LBP with pain radiating down the left leg. Similar to the first episode, the patient reported that the LBP had come on after an 8-h shift of driving a patrol car. However, this time the leg pain was radiating down the anterior aspect of the left thigh to the knee. He was taking prescription pain killers as directed by his general practitioner (1–2 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone [Endone, Aspen Pharamceuticals] per 6 h). However, the medication provided minimal relief and the pain was unrelenting, worse at night, and interfering with his sleep. Bladder and bowel function was normal. The physical examination mirrored the initial presentation but for two findings: (1) light touch was decreased in the left L3 and L4 dermatomes, and (2) slump test produced left anterior thigh pain radiating down to the left knee and lateral leg to the foot.\nBecause the patient now presented with indications of the possible involvement of multiple lumbar nerve roots, severe pain waking him up at night, and not responding to strong prescription pain medication, he was referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for an evaluation of possible compression of neurological structures at the L2 to L4 vertebral levels.\nThe MRI revealed a substantial heterogeneous space-occupying lesion with an intramedullary orientation within the filum terminale at the L2/3 vertebral level (see Fig. ). The lesion measured approximately 2.5 cm × 1.2 cm in the craniocaudal and anterior-posterior dimensions, respectively. It appeared predominantly cystic on T2-weighted sequences and contained several fine internal septations. On post-contrast imaging, there was a heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion (predominantly peripheral), with a non-enhancing central aspect indicating a possible haemorrhagic or calcific component. The remainder of the spinal cord and conus medullaris appeared normal. Because the observed lesion most likely represented a myxoapapillary ependymoma, the patient was promptly referred for a neurosurgical consultation.\nThe patient was scheduled for surgery the day after the neurosurgical consultation. A gross total resection was achieved and radiological adjunctive therapy was not pursued. Although the patient reported resolution of the neurological symptoms immediately after the surgery, low-grade LBP (3/10 VAS), described as a dull ache, still persisted for several weeks post-surgery. The patient received standard, post-surgical rehabilitation with a hospital-based physiotherapist for 6 months post-surgery. In long-term follow-ups at 6 and 12 months post-surgery, the patient reported no pain (0/10 VAS), with only a vague sensation of persistent numbness in the left anterior leg.", "tokens": ["48",

Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Routine investigation revealed haemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dl and marginally elevated alkaline phosphatase of 110 mg/dl. Abdominal ultrasound scans revealed a 7.2 × 6.8 cm thin-walled partially cystic and solid structure adjacent to the inferior margin of the left lobe of liver.\nComputerised tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirmed a partly cystic and partly solid mass with some contrast enhancement and low volume ascitis (figure , ). She was discussed in the upper gastrointestinal multidisciplinary team meeting. The mass was thought to be a bleeding liver lesion. Selective mesenteric and hepatic angiography with a view to embolisation was performed.\nAngiography showed normal hepatic artery architecture. Distal gastroduodenal and gastro-epiploic catheterisation exhibited tumour neo-vascularisation (figure ), which was not amenable to embolisation. The appearance was thought to be consistent with either a GIST or a liposarcoma due to the hypervascular picture with many early filling abnormal vessels, unusually sustained tumour blush and prominent draining veins. At laparotomy there was an exophytic lesion arising from the antrum of the stomach with signs of bleeding into the tumour. The tumour was locally excised with clear margins.\nThe histology confirmed a 4.5 × 3.5 cm GIST with evidence of recent haemorrhage, strongly positive for CD117 with negative resection margins and a favourable mitotic number of <5/50 HPF.

{"_id": "2803931-1", "title": "", "text": "A 42-year-old Mediterranean male presented complaining of inability to sustain good oral care at the posterior aspect of the lower right jaw. The main problems were food impaction in the area and the subsequent malodor. The patient reported remarkable medical history, and he was a non-smoker. Clinical examination revealed local erytherma with noticeable bony defect distal to the second molar with obvious defect in the mesial wall of the third molar; the penetration depth was found to be up to 6 mm (Figure ).\nRadiological evaluation confirmed the defect and it was attributed to the mesioangularly impacted lower third molar; there was marked dilation or thickening of the lamina dura secondary to the local inflammatory reaction. It was decided that the third molar should be extracted and concentrate of the patient's growth factors (PRGF) to be implanted into the bony defect to stimulate bone regeneration and promote healing(Figure ).\nPreoperatively, 24 cc of the patient's blood (venous blood from a peripheral vessel) was obtained using a butterfly cannula. The blood was collected in five sterile glass tubes, pretreated with 3,8% trisodium citrate (anticoagulant factor) and then centrifuged at 460 g for 8 mins at room temperature (PRGF System, BTI Biotechnology Institute, Vitoria, Spain) []. After centrifugation, blood was separated into distinct layers, with the cellular fraction located at the bottom of the tubes and the plasmatic fraction located just above the red blood cell line. Plasma volume constituted 1 cc and was located just above the red blood cell line. This fraction appears to be very rich in growth factors []. A volume of approximately 5 cc of PRGF was collected in a tube and 50 μl of 10% calcium chloride (CaCl2) were added per 1 cc of PRGF []. CaCl2 activates PRGF and stimulates the formation of a semi-solid, scaffold-like mass which functions as a matrix for progenitor cells and maintains the regenerative area of the defect []. After activation, PRGF was mounted on a spatula and ready to be applied to the bony defect (Figure ).\nThe surgical part of this case study took place under local anesthesia. A transginigival incision was made after tissue infiltration with local anesthesia. A buccal mucoperiosteal flap was raised and bone was exposed. The third molar was elevated and removed, followed by debridement and curettage of all debris and granulation tissue in the area. Subsequently, the 'scaffold-like', CaCl2 activated PRGF was implanted in the bony defect. The volume of PRGF was adequate to provide full cover of the whole defect. The flap was carefully repositioned and sutured with horizontal mattress sutures. An immediate postoperative dental panoramic tomography was obtained and considered as the \"baseline image\" for this case study (Figure ). The patient was given full postoperative instructions, including contact details if postoperative complications to occur. Also, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial cover was provided for 5 days.\nAt the first postoperative day, moderate pain was the main complaint and was controlled by NSAIDs. After two days, the pain subsided. No postoperative swelling was reported by the patient. There were neither symptoms nor clinical suspicion that would suggest alveolar osteitis (dry socket), indicating normal clotting and coagulation [,]. One week postoperatively, the sutures were removed and there was good tissue healing on examination.\nOn the fiftieth postoperative day, and according to the PRGF clinical protocol, radiographic evaluation took place and showed noticeable enhancement of density and radio-opacity in the third molar socket area, in comparison with the baseline image (Figure and Figure ).

FNA was performed now, which showed cohesive clusters of ductal cells and fragments of myxoid stroma with a fine fibrillar structure. An air-dried preparation showed metachromatic stroma interdigitating intimately with small tumor cells with uniform nuclei with scanty cytoplasm. But, at places, these cells were arranged around small hyaline globules in a pattern suggestive of possible adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) []. Repeat aspiration was performed to document the third element of PA. A diligent search revealed plasmacytoid cells. A cytodiagnosis of PA was made based on the above findings.

{"_id": "7287196-1", "title": "", "text": "A 50-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of pain and swelling on her right\nfirst toe. The patient reported no preceding history of significant trauma or\ninflammation and no signs of arthritis of the right foot. Her medical history\nincluded diagnosis of an undifferentiated nasopharyngeal neoplasm 6 years\npreviously. In 2011 she had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which is the\nstandard treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer., The initial response was\ncomplete, and the patient was followed up by clinical examination every 6 months.\nPulmonary metastases and coughing were noted 1 year before the current presentation,\nand palliative care was instituted. The cough was relieved and the patient\ndiscontinued further treatment.\nPhysical examination revealed a tender, firm, red swelling on the right big toe\n(). The pain\nincreased when pressure was applied on the toe. The patient exhibited decreased\nactive interphalangeal flexion. No loss of sensation or passive range of motion was\nfound. The neurovascular status of the digit was normal. Blood tests revealed an\ninflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein concentration of 35.25 mg/L). The\npatient’s symptoms were partially eased by anti-inflammatory drugs. Radiographs\nshowed an osteolytic process involving the distal phalanx of the right big toe with\nno periosteal reaction (). Magnetic resonance imaging (Siemens Essenza 1.5T scanner; Siemens\nHealthineers, Erlangen, Germany) showed a mass in the distal phalanx of the right\nbig toe. The dimensions of the tumor were 2.3 × 2.0 × 2.1 cm. The mass showed equal\nsignal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted\nimages. The tumor showed significant enhancement after administration of contrast\nagent ().\nClinical evaluation indicated a malignant tumor. Options of amputation versus wide\nresection and toe salvage were discussed with the patient, and the decision was made\nto perform amputation through the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The surgical\nprocedure was performed under general anesthesia. A tourniquet was used to avoid\nhemorrhage. After toe amputation, a piece of skin was used to cover the wound.\nMacroscopically, the lesion contained necrotic tissue with bony invasion. The lesion\nwas referred for histologic analysis because of these atypical intraoperative\nfindings.\nGrossly, the tumor tissue appeared as a soft gray mass measuring 2.6 × 1.7 cm.\nMicroscopically, invasive tumor growth was evident as shown by clusters of malignant\ncells featuring central necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positive\nexpression of p63, CK5/6, and EBER and negative expression of CD56, CgA, and Syn\n(). These\nfindings were similar to the primary nasopharyngeal neoplasm diagnosed 6 years\npreviously and confirmed the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal metastasis with negative\nsurgical margins.\nThe patient underwent antibiotic therapy for 1 week after the surgery. The wound\nhealed well, and no infection occurred. Two weeks after the surgery, the patient was\nable to walk and her pain had resolved. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful,\nand she was referred to an oncologist. The patient underwent a clinical follow-up\nexamination every month. Six months after surgery, she had experienced no symptom\nrecurrence.\nThis case report followed the CARE guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the\nMedical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,\nZhejiang University.

It was a large, painless, progressive swelling in the perineum, involving the labial fold. There were no bowel obstruction symptoms. She was previously operated for the hernia three times in different centers. On examination, there was a large swelling extending from the right medial gluteal area to the right labial fold measuring 20 × 15 cm. It was nontender and had a firm consistency, with no overlying skin changes (). Laboratory investigations were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis showed a massive, multicompartmental, multilobulated soft-tissue lesion in the lower pelvis and perineum, exerting a mild mass effect (). Perineal mass excision, possible mesh placement and stoma creation was planned. At exploratory laparotomy, the abdominal and pelvic cavities were examined. There was no evidence of a defect or hernia. The extraperitoneal space was explored and the obturator foramen was identified without any hernia. The procedure then shifted to excision of the mass. It was lobulated within a capsule and extending from the vulvar commissure to the anus. It was also involving part of the lateral vaginal wall, the lower part of the rectum and anal canal which needed to be excised (). The mass was directly subdermal at the vulvar commissure site, so part of the labia minora skin was excised with the mass. The vaginal wall was repaired by a urogynecologist. The rectum was repaired by the primary surgeon. A diversion end sigmoid colostomy was created. Wound closure was assisted by plastic surgery. No tissue or skin coverage was required. The histopathological report revealed an AA extending to the margins with ulcerated and reactive skin tissue. Immunostaining for estrogen and progesterone were both positive. The postoperative course was uneventful. At 8 months follow-up, abdomen and pelvis CT concluded that there was a minimal residual perineal mass without extension to the pelvis. Following discussion in the multidisciplinary tumor board, she was started on hormonal therapy after ~1 year of surgery with leuprolide 22.5 mg, intramuscular, every 3 months. Hormonal therapy was continued for a total of 15 months with frequent follow-up images which showed no change in the residual mass.

The patient denied relevant pathological medical history except for short-lasting episodes of palpitations. She was on no regular medication and denied substance abuse.\nEarly medical examination in the ER revealed paleness, cold sweat, epistaxis, and signs of pulmonary oedema due to a new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (170 b.p.m.); blood pressure (BP) was 230/110 mmHg and SpO2 was 96%.\nBlood tests revealed leucocytosis, hyperglycaemia (309 mg/dL—normal range 70–110 mg/dL) and troponin T elevation (151 ng/L—normal range 0–14 ng/L). Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis. Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment depression in the lower lateral leads. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed too, showing 33% left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with diffuse akinesia.\nThe patient was sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Polypharmacological therapy, including amiodarone, bisoprolol, nitroglycerine, furosemide, ticagrelor, acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, ceftriaxone, and pantoprazole was started.\nThe patient was subsequently transferred to a II level emergency department. At her arrival, she presented with anisocoria, BP was 220/100 mmHg, heart rate was 160, and SpO2 was 74%. Blood gas analysis showed persistent severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels (5.8 mmol/L—normal value <2 mmol/L). A new TTE was performed, showing 20–30% LVEF. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral symmetrical and diffuse alveolar opacities ().\nGiven the sustained hypertension (mean arterial pressure 140 mmHg), despite sedation and maximal pharmacological therapy, resulting in progressive haemodynamic impairment with low ejection fraction, severe pulmonary oedema, and metabolic acidosis, the patient underwent urgent venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) in the cath lab. Coronary angiography did not show any coronary artery stenosis. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device (IMPELLA) was implanted. Three endomyocardial biopsies were obtained, subsequently turning out to be negative for myocarditis but suggestive of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient was then admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.\nIn the following day, she developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 33000 plt/mm3—normal range 150 000–450 000 plt/mm3) and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT).\nOn 29 July, sedation was transiently stopped. Neurological evaluation revealed right hemiplegia. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan showed hypodense (ischaemic) bilateral parieto-occipital areas and a hypodense subcortical area in the left frontal lobe (). Abdominal CT scan revealed a 5 cm tumour of the left adrenal gland compatible with pheochromocytoma ().\nOn 30 and 31 July, ECMO and IMPELLA were respectively removed, due to a gradually recovery of the LVEF. Hypertensive crisis and episodes of atrial fibrillation were treated with urapidil, esmolol, and amiodarone. CT scan was repeated confirming the previous findings.\nAs it was not possible to determine urinary metanephrines due to the ongoing RRT, on 1 August, plasmatic catecholamines were dosed, showing increased adrenaline and noradrenaline levels and therefore confirming pheochromocytoma diagnosis.\nOn 2 August, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of bilateral parieto-occipital ischaemic lesions of recent onset. Ischaemic lesions of the right cerebellum, right centrum semiovale and left frontal subcortical region where also found. Intense vasogenic oedema accompanied these lesions (), thus suggesting the diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).\nOn 5 August, the patient was transferred from the cardiothoracic intensive care unit to the Department of Shock and Trauma of the same hospital. Neurological evaluation showed persistence of the right hemiplegia. She was still sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Sedation with sufentanil, propofol, and dexmedetomidine improved BP control. Moreover, antihypertensive therapy with doxazosin 16 mg/day and labetalol by continuous intravenous infusion was started, leading to rapid BP and heart rate control. Due to persistent oligo anuria, RRT was continued.\nThe following days, haemodynamic stability was reached: labetalol infusion was stopped and doxazosin administration was reduced up to 4 mg × 2/day.\nOn 13 August, left videolaparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The same day, doxazosin treatment was stopped. On 14 August, the patient was extubated. She was discharged from our department on 22 August. She was conscious; no residual focal deficit could be detected at neurological examination. She was breathing spontaneously. RRT had been stopped due to autonomous diuresis.\nOn 25 August, she was discharged from hospital. TTE was repeated before discharge, revealing complete recovery of left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 58%). Grade I diastolic dysfunction persisted, as suggested by E/A reversal (ratio < 1.0).", "tokens": ["italian", "caucasian", "28", "year", "woman", "transported", "ambulance", "emergency", "room", "er",

{"_id": "7933630-1", "title": "", "text": "A 24-year-old female patient presented to clinic with right shoulder pain and decreased range of motion (ROM). Her symptoms began 1 year before presentation, but significantly worsened over the last month. She used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which alleviated the pain at the beginning but failed to do so in the last couple of months. Her history was negative for any traumatic events, fever, chills, and skin lesions. She did not report any other musculoskeletal symptoms. Her previous medical history and family history were noncontributory.\nOn physical examination, the patient’s active and passive right shoulder motion was markedly decreased with abduction to 45°, forward flexion to 45°, and abducted internal/external rotation each 30°. The joint was mildly tender on palpation, and the pain was mainly motion related. There was no swelling or erythema of the joint. Her distal pulses were palpable and neurological examination was normal. Detailed orthopedic examination of the axial and appendicular skeleton did not reveal any other findings.\nHer initial right shoulder X-rays revealed joint space narrowing and marginal osteophytes, resembling primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (). An MRI was ordered to reveal the cause of the significant loss of ROM and arthritic changes. Shoulder MRI (with i.v. gadolinium contrast) was reported as “extensive capsulitis and synovitis, synovial thickening/proliferation zones suggestive of PVNS, and a localized nodular component with a diameter of 12 mm. Glenoid cartilage erosion and marginal osteophyte formation” ().\nThe patient underwent arthroscopic debridement and synovial biopsy of the shoulder with PVNS as a pre-diagnosis. During the surgery, the extensive hypertrophied synovial tissue was debrided, and samples were taken from the nodular portion of the thickened synovium which was also clearly seen on the MRI (). Articular cartilage was also found to be injured, with delaminated areas on both humeral and glenoid surfaces. Early post-operative physical therapy was initiated, and the patient was kept in a sling for 3 weeks.\nHistologic examination of the synovial tissue unexpectedly came back as non-LCH of the synovium (). Microscopic appearance was not suggestive of malignant behavior. The tumor had both lymphoid and histiocytic proliferations in a fibroadipose tissue, with the histiocytic component showing significant pleomorphism and occasional giant cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the neoplastic histiocytic cells was positive for CD163 and CD68 (); negative for CD1a, S100, Langerin, fascin, CD33, CD30, HMB45, pankeratin, and MPO. Following these results, the patient was worked up and staged by the hematology/oncology service. Further radiographic examinations including a PET scan and cranial MRI were normal. No further medical therapy was needed.\nThe patient’s post-operative clinical course was unremarkable. She was pain-free 1 month after surgery, with a significantly better ROM. On her post-operative 3rd month examination, she had pain-free abduction and flexion to 160, internal and external rotation to 75 ().

On local examination, there was gross facial asymmetry with a single diffuse swelling over left side of the face extending suproinferiorly from the zygomatic arch to about 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible into the submandibular region. Antero-posteriorly the swelling extended from the angle of the mouth up to the tragus of the ear measuring approximately 8 cm × 5 cm × 3 cm with obliteration of nasolabial fold on the left side. The skin overlying the swelling had a taut and shiny appearance [].\nOn palpation the swelling was firm, tender and nonfluctuant. Lymph node examination revealed single, oval-shaped, mobile node in the left submandibular region.\nIntraorally there was single, diffuse large proliferative growth extending from the mandibular incisor region to the retromolar trigone and crossing over to the lingual side up to the premolar region measuring 8 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in greatest dimension. The overlying mucosa had a corrugated appearance with areas of hyperpigmentation and slough []. Oral hygiene was poor and carious teeth were present in all four quadrants. A computer tomographic scan was taken to see for the extent of bony involvement which revealed erosion of buccal and lingual cortices. It also revealed an expansile lesion involving buccal and submandibular space [].\nChest X-ray (postero-anterior view) revealed multiple radiopaque foci which were suggestive of old-treated Koch's [].\nThe swelling was subjected to incisional biopsy under local anesthesia. The hematoxylin-eosin stained section showed diffuse sheets of monotonous lymphocytes homogenous in size and shape with intensely basophilic vacuolated cytoplasm. A large number of abnormal mitotic figures were seen. Dilated blood vessels and areas of extravasated erythrocytes were seen between undifferentiated lymphocytes [].\nThe histopathologic diagnosis was suggestive of NHL.\nTo identify the subtype of NHL, immunohistochemistry was performed using CD45, CD20, and CD3 markers. The patient upon definitive diagnosis of NHL was started on palliative chemotherapy. Although partial regression of primary tumor was present, unfortunately the patient was lost to follow-up following 6 months after chemotherapy after being discharged from our unit.", "tokens": ["42", "year", "female", "hiv", "seropositivity", "past", "6", "years", "reported", "department", "complaint", "nonresolving", "swelling", "left", "side", "face", "past", "2", "months", "duration", "gave", "history", "noticing", "intraoral", "growth", "mandibular", "left", "posterior", "region", "past", "3", "weeks", "swelling", "accompanied", "progressive", "decrease", "mouth", "opening", "loss", "appetite", "rapid", "increase", "size", "intraoral", "growth", "significant", "weight", "loss", "6", "kg", "past", "2", "months", "complained", "fever", "night", "sweats", "easy", "fatigability", "patient", "referred", "institute", "general", "physician", "due", "nonresolving", "nature", "swelling", "medical", "records", "notice", "patient", "diagnosed", "hiv", "positive", "year", "2010", "art", "cd4", "counts", "time", "presentation", "58", "local", "examination", "gross", "facial", "asymmetry", "single", "diffuse", "swelling", "left", "side", "face", "extending", "suproinferiorly", "zygomatic", "arch", "2", "cm", "inferior", "border", "mandible", "submandibular", "region", "antero", "posteriorly", "swelling", "extended", "angle", "mouth", "tragus", "ear", "measuring", "approximately", "8", "cm", "5", "cm", "3", "cm", "obliteration", "nasolabial", "fold", "left", "side", "skin", "overlying", "swelling", "taut", "shiny", "appearance", "palpation", "swelling", "firm", "tender", "nonfluctuant", "lymph", "node", "examination", "revealed", "single", "oval", "shaped", "mobile", "node", "left", "submandibular", "region", "intraorally", "single", "diffuse", "large", "proliferative", "growth", "extending", "mandibular", "incisor", "region", "retromolar", "trigone", "crossing", "lingual", "side", "premolar", "region", "measuring", "8", "cm", "4", "cm", "4", "cm", "greatest", "dimension", "overlying", "mucosa", "corrugated", "appearance", "areas", "hyperpigmentation", "slough", "oral", "hygiene", "poor", "carious", "teeth", "present", "quadrants", "computer", "tomographic", "scan", "extent", "bony", "involvement", "revealed", "erosion", "buccal", "lingual", "cortices", "revealed", "expansile", "lesion", "involving", "buccal", "submandibular", "space", "chest", "x", "ray", "postero", "anterior", "view", "revealed", "multiple", "radiopaque", "foci", "suggestive", "treated", "koch", "s", "swelling", "subjected", "incisional", "biopsy", "local", "anesthesia", "hematoxylin", "eosin", "stained", "section", "showed", "diffuse", "sheets", "monotonous", "lymphocytes", "homogenous", "size", "shape", "intensely", "basophilic", "vacuolated", "cytoplasm", "large", "number", "abnormal", "mitotic", "figures", "dilated", "blood", "vessels", "areas", "extravasated", "erythrocytes", "undifferentiated", "lymphocytes", "histopathologic", "diagnosis", "suggestive", "nhl", "identify", "subtype", "nhl", "immunohistochemistry", "performed", "cd45", "cd20", "cd3", "markers", "patient", "definitive", "diagnosis", "nhl", "started", "palliative", "chemotherapy", "partial", "regression", "primary", "tumor", "present", "patient", "lost", "follow", "6", "months", "chemotherapy", "discharged", "unit"]}

Three days after the angioplasty; i.e., one week prior to presentation to the emergency room, an inguinal hematoma developed as complication of the femoral arteriography had to be drained. Thereafter, the patient suffered from constipation and had difficulties with evacuation. On the day the woman presented to the emergency room, she felt a sudden and dull abdominal discomfort during evacuation and noticed a loop of bowel protruding from her vagina. There was no history of abdominal or vaginal trauma.\nThirty years prior to the present admission, the woman had undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy for a benign pathology. The operation had no complications, and the patient’s recovery was uneventful. After the hysterectomy and ten and twelve years prior to the present admission, the woman had undergone two perinea surgeries for a prolapsed bladder. Apart from these three surgeries, the she had no past medical or gynecological history worthy of note.\nUpon admission to the emergency room, the patient’s blood pressure was 110 × 70 mmHg, her heart rate was 88 bpm, and an abdominal examination indicated significant pain. The pelvic examination revealed 40 cm of small bowel prolapsing through her vagina (). After resuscitation of the patient, she received intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics (1 g of Ceftriaxon and 500 mg of Metronidazole), and her bowel was wrapped with warm, sterile, and saline-soaked gauze for transfer to the operating room. There, under rachianesthesia, the woman was placed in lithotomy position, so that the viability of her small bowel could be assessed. The examination revealed that the bowel was edematous and thick-walled, but still viable. There was no evidence of necrosis. The inguinal hematoma, which looked infected, was drained (). The patient was then placed in the Trendelenburg position. Because the vault defect was located high in the vagina, all attempts to transvaginally reduce the small bowel into the peritoneal cavity were unsuccessful. Consequently, a midline subumbilical incision was made, and the prolapsed bowel was reduced into the abdomen and inspected for damage throughout its length. Thereafter, the vaginal vault defect was closed with absorbable sutures (Polygleprone 2.0) by a vaginal route (), and a 30-cm segment of bowel was excised. Although the bowel was viable, we decided to carry out this procedure because there was an expansible hematoma in the mesum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were postoperatively given for six days. The patient had no postoperative complications and was discharged from the hospital after six days. In a follow-up examination three months later, the woman exhibited no evidence of recurrence, and the vaginal vault had healed satisfactorily.", "tokens": ["female", "patient", "aged", "seventy", "years", "admitted", "emergency", "room", "abdominal", "pain", "ten", "days", "angioplasty", "coronary", "stent", "implantation", "performed", "femoral", "artery", "days", "angioplasty", "i", "e", "week", "prior", "presentation", "emergency", "room", "inguinal", "hematoma", "developed", "complication", "femoral", "arteriography", "drained", "patient", "suffered", "constipation", "difficulties", "evacuation", "day", "woman", "presented", "emergency", "room", "felt", "sudden", "dull", "abdominal", "discomfort", "evacuation", "noticed", "loop", "bowel", "protruding", "vagina", "history", "abdominal", "vaginal", "trauma", "thirty", "years", "prior", "present", "admission", "woman", "undergone", "total", "abdominal", "hysterectomy", "benign", "pathology", "operation", "complications", "patient", "s", "recovery", "uneventful", "hysterectomy", "ten", "twelve", "years", "prior", "present", "admission", "woman", "undergone", "perinea", "surgeries", "prolapsed", "bladder", "surgeries", "past", "medical", "gynecological", "history", "worthy", "note", "admission", "emergency", "room", "patient", "s", "blood", "pressure", "110", "70", "mmhg", "heart", "rate", "88", "bpm", "abdominal", "examination", "significant", "pain", "pelvic", "examination", "revealed", "40", "cm", "small", "bowel", "prolapsing", "vagina", "resuscitation", "patient", "received", "intravenous", "broad", "spectrum", "antibiotics", "1", "g", "ceftriaxon", "500", "mg", "metronidazole", "bowel", "wrapped", "warm", "sterile", "saline", "soaked", "gauze", "transfer", "operating", "room", "rachianesthesia", "woman", "lithotomy", "position", "viability", "small", "bowel", "assessed", "examination", "revealed", "bowel", "edematous", "thick", "walled", "viable", "evidence", "necrosis", "inguinal", "hematoma", "looked", "infected", "drained", "patient", "trendelenburg", "position", "vault", "defect", "located", "high", "vagina", "attempts", "transvaginally", "reduce", "small", "bowel", "peritoneal", "cavity", "unsuccessful", "midline", "subumbilical", "incision", "made", "prolapsed", "bowel", "reduced", "abdomen", "inspected", "damage", "length", "vaginal", "vault", "defect", "closed", "absorbable", "sutures", "polygleprone", "2", "0", "vaginal", "route", "30", "cm", "segment", "bowel", "excised", "bowel", "viable", "decided", "carry", "procedure", "expansible", "hematoma", "mesum", "broad", "spectrum", "antibiotics", "postoperatively", "days", "patient", "postoperative", "complications", "discharged", "hospital", "days", "follow", "examination", "months", "woman", "exhibited", "evidence", "recurrence", "vaginal", "vault", "healed", "satisfactorily"]}
{"_id": "6109193-1", "title": "", "text": "A 51-year-old male living in a rural part of western Norway was hospitalized after 2 weeks of influenza-like symptoms including fever, mild headache and a reduced general condition. During the last week before hospitalization, his wife had noted abdominal distention. Otherwise, no focal symptoms were noted. Two days prior to admittance, he started oral penicillin because of bacterial sinusitis. Previous medical history was significant for alcohol abuse, pancreatitis and alcoholic liver cirrhosis.\nAt admittance, he had memory and orientation impairment. Physical examination revealed blood pressure 133/85 mmHg, heart rate 107 beats per minute, temperature 40.3°C, respiratory rate 24 per minute and oxygen saturation 97%. He had scleral icterus and the abdomen was significantly distended although he denied abdominal pain. Laboratory tests showed leukocytes 8.8 × 109/l (references: 4.3–10 × 109/l), platelet count 26 × 109/l (references: 145–348 × 109/l), hemoglobin 13.8 g/dl (references: 13.4–17.0 g/dl), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1 (references: <1.1), activated partial thromboplastin time 41 s (references: 28–48 s), sodium 133 mmol/l (references: 137–145 mmol/l), potassium 3.2 mmol/l (references: 3.5–5.0 mmol/l), magnesium 0.56 mmol/l (references: 0.71–0.94 mmol/l), creatinine 58 μmol/l (references: 60–105 μmol/l), alanine aminotransferase 59 U/l (references: <70 U/l), alkaline phosphatase 171 U/l (references: <105 U/l), C-reactive protein (CRP) 123 mg/l (references: <5 mg/l), gamma glutamyl transferase 2016 U/l (references: <115 U/l), amylase 59 U/l (references: >120 U/l), bilirubin 42 μmol/l (references: 5–25 μmo/l). Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C antibodies were all negative and serum antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detected. Computer tomography (CT) of the skull and brain revealed signs of sinusitis. Ultrasound of the liver was consistent with cirrhosis and ascites. Blood cultures were taken before cefotaxime was prescribed for his sinusitis and a potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, he was given thiamine prophylaxis against Wernicke’s encephalopathy.\nOver the next 6 days, he developed decompensated liver failure, CRP increased to 200 mg/l, bilirubin to 159 μmol/l and INR to 1.5. Microbiological cultures were negative. A systemic autoimmune condition was considered unlikely because of negative immunological tests. He was persistently febrile, confused and developed an increasing oxygen demand. A CT scan of his thorax and abdomen showed bilateral pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis revealed one liter of bloody pleural fluid and a bronchoscopy including a bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Because of liver cirrhosis, he was considered to be at risk for infections with atypical and opportunistic microbes. However, BAL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for Pneumocystis jiroveci and Legionella pneumophila. Blood cultures were repeated and incubated for an extended time period together with samples from the pleural effusions. The antibiotics were changed to meropenem and ciprofloxacin to better cover gram negative and intracellular microbes. Additionally, fluconazole was added to provide coverage for the possibility of infection with Candida species. However, his condition did not improve and he developed progressive multi-organ failure and increasing encephalopathy. Due to poor compliance and ongoing alcohol abuse, he was not considered to be a candidate for liver transplantation. Death occurred 12 days after admittance.\nOn the following day, there was growth of gram-negative coccobacilli on the chocolate agar from the pleural fluid specimen and later also in the blood cultures, after incubation for 5 and 8 days, respectively. The isolates were identified as F. tularensis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Maldi-Tof MS, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen).

Physical examination showed tachycardia and hepatomegaly with tenderness on palpation, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed normal levels of complete blood count and liver function parameters. Alpha-fetoprotein was within normal levels. An abdominal computed tomography showed a 20×16 cm-sized cystic lesion in the right hepatic lobule, with multiple septae and hypervascularization. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the finding and showed compression of intrahepatic vascular structures including portal vein ().\nThe patient underwent extended right hepatectomy without complications. Histopathological study reported high-grade undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma with negative margins and without lymphovascular and perineural invasion, or gangliona metastasis. The patient was discharged without pain and remained stable for two years, when a cystic lesion on the surgical site was documented during the follow-up. The lesion was located close to one of the main branches of the portal vein, and contraindicated for surgical resection.\nDue to disease recurrence, chemotherapy with doxorubicin and isophosphamide was scheduled; however, only three cycles were administered due to hematological toxicity manifesting as neutropenia and fever.

His heart rate was 58 b.p.m., blood pressure 97/52 mmHg, and SpO2 94% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed increased intensity of P2 and pansystolic murmur at the third right intercostal space on auscultation and parasternal heave. The lung field were clear. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography showed perimembranous-type VSD (18 × 18 mm) with left-to-right shunt, dilated right ventricle, and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 91 mmHg (Figure –C; see also , Video S3). Right heart catheterization showed mPAP 71 mmHg, PVRi 9.0 Wood units/m2, Qp/Qs 1.59, and Rp/Rs 0.41 (Table ).

{"_id": "4075891-1", "title": "", "text": "We report the case of a 73-year-old White male patient who was a retired construction\nworker, having worked as a mason's assistant most of his economically active life. The\npatient was a former smoker (smoking history, 10 pack-years). Over a 6-month period, he\nhad daily episodes of dry cough, dyspnea, and wheezing that improved, albeit partially,\nwith the use of intravenous xanthine and an inhaled β2 agonist, having often\nsought emergency room treatment. The patient was referred to our hospital after the\nidentification of a lung tumor on a chest X-ray. He reported no fever, chest pain, or\nbloodstained sputum. In addition, he reported weight loss (3 kg) during that period.\nThe patient had systemic arterial hypertension and reflux esophagitis, both of which\nwere controlled. He reported no diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic respiratory diseases, or\ncontact with tuberculosis patients.\nThe patient reported no alcoholism. In addition, he reported that he had raised animals\nwhen he was young and that he had been exposed to smoke from wood-burning stoves until\nthe age of 25 years.\nPhysical examination revealed good general health. The patient had pallor of the skin\nand mucosa, and his body mass index was 29.7 kg/m2. He was well hydrated and\nwas breathing normally, having no jaundice or cyanosis. In addition, he had no digital\nclubbing or lymph node enlargement. Respiratory findings included increased\nanteroposterior chest diameter, normal breath sounds, and diffuse wheezing. Arterial\noxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Cardiovascular and abdominal examination was\nnormal. No leg edema, varicose veins, or ulcers were observed.\nSpirometry revealed mild obstructive lung disease unresponsive to bronchodilators. The\nMantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed, and the induration was 15 mm.\nCounterimmunoelectrophoresis for antifungal serum antibodies was negative for\ncryptococcosis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis.\nA CT scan of the chest () showed a\nhypodense tumor mass located in the right upper lobe and measuring 5.0 × 3.5 cm. The\nmajor axis of the mass was directed toward the pulmonary hilum.\nWegener's granulomatosis was ruled out by negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\ntest results associated with an absence of specific upper airway and nervous system\nsymptoms.\nFiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed on two occasions, having shown extrinsic\nobstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus and its segmental bronchi. In addition, the\nbronchial mucosa appeared to be infiltrated. However, analysis of the biopsy samples was\ninconclusive, a surgical approach being therefore adopted.\nThe surgical specimen consisted of a cavitary mass in the right upper lobe (the contents\nof which were thick) and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.\nPathological examination of the mass revealed a dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate\nthat was granulomatous and exudative, as well as extensive areas of caseous necrosis,\nfibrosis, and giant cell reaction (); none\nof the various sections examined met histopathological criteria for malignancy. The\npresence of intracytoplasmic crystalloid structures in the adjacent lung parenchyma (as\nrevealed by H&E staining) constituted evidence of silicosis (). The mediastinal lymph nodes showed a marked chronic\ninflammatory infiltrate that was granulomatous and exudative, as well as extensive areas\nof necrosis, lymph node architecture being extensively effaced.\nSerial histological sections were examined under oil immersion (total magnification,\n×1,000). Ziehl-Neelsen staining and the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver stain\ntechnique were used in order to screen for AFB and fungi, respectively, and the results\nwere negative for all histological slides. However, culture was positive for\nMycobacterium tuberculosis.\nThe lung mass was tested in an automated culture system, and there was M.\ntuberculosis growth. In this technique, the tubes containing the biopsy\nmaterial (classically macerated and decontaminated) are monitored in an automated\nculture system (BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960; Becton Dickinson,\nSparks, MD, USA) for up to 42 days of incubation, and any microorganism growing in a\ngiven tube emits fluorescence detectable by the system sensors, which indicate the tube\nas positive. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was used in order to screen the positive material\nfor AFB, and the material was cultured on Löwenstein-Jensen medium for approximately 10\ndays. Mycobacterial colonies were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, which\nidentified M. tuberculosis by insertion sequence\nIS6110. Culture of the lung tissue surrounding the mass was\nnegative; the lymph node samples were lost.\nLung tissue and mediastinal lymph node samples were cultured on Sabouraud agar,\nCryptococcus neoformans having been isolated after 72 h of\nincubation. For metabolic recovery of the yeast and identification of\nCryptococcus sp., a subculture of that isolate was performed, also\non Sabouraud agar. The genus and species were confirmed by the VITEK 2 Compact and 21343\nYST Test Kit VTK 2 automated system (bioMérieux, Marcy I'Étoile, France). The turbidity\nof the final suspension of saline solution containing the isolated colonies was analyzed\nwith a DensiCHEK Plus device (bioMérieux), the results being within the 1.80-2.20 range,\nas established by the manufacturer. A fragment of the lung mass was cultured, and the\nresults were negative.\nThe patient received pharmacological treatment, being treated with a regimen of\nrifampin, hydrazide, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampin and\nhydrazide for 4 months, in accordance with current recommendations for the treatment of\ntuberculosis.(\n) In addition, he received itraconazole for 6 months.\nAt 5 months of pharmacological treatment for tuberculosis, the patient presented with a\nsymmetric and painful increase in the mammary glands, which remained increased after the\nend of the treatment. We attribute this to a rare side effect of hydrazide, which has\nbeen reported by other authors.(\n)", "tokens": ["report", "case", "73", "year", "white", "male", "patient", "retired", "construction",

{"_id": "4733512-1", "title": "", "text": "A 68-year-old female, right hand dominant, slipped on ice and fell on her left outstretched hand. There were no open wound, no neurovascular deficit and no other significant injuries. The skin was not at risk. Standard x-rays of the shoulder girdle showed a minimally displaced lateral fracture and a second displaced medial fracture of the left clavicle. A conservative treatment was proposed with regard to the patient’s age and her low functional demand. A week later the assessment was completed by a computed tomography (CT) scan which underlined a displaced medial fracture with shortening of the clavicle bone (). This statement drove us to propose a final fixation of the clavicle by means of two locking plates. The hardware used consisted of two 3.5/2.7 locking compression (LC) anatomical plates with a lateral extension (DePuy Synthes®, United States). A left sided plate was used for the lateral fracture and placed cranially while a right sided plate was used for the medial fracture and placed anteriorly. The patient was operated in beach chair position under general anesthesia. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given at the induction. A longitudinal anterior incision was used. The reduction of the medial side of the intermediate segment of the clavicle was particularly difficult due to the small medial fragment still attached to the sternoclavicular joint, and the rupture of the costoclavicular ligament and the lever arm produced by the coracoclavicular ligaments still attached to the lateral side of the intermediate fragment. Fixation of the lateral fracture facilitated the reduction and fixation of the medial fracture. Three 2.7 mm locking screws were placed in the medial fragment and stabilized the sternoclavicular joint by means of a transosseous non-resorbable suture of #2 FiberWire (Arthrex®, United States) running through two holes of the extension of the right sided plate placed anteriorly and through two tunnels of 2 mm of diameter drilled in the manubrium. Early passive and active mobilization of the left shoulder was begun from the second postoperative day. A sling was used for six weeks as antalgic support and the abduction of the left arm was limited to 90° during this period because of the poor quality of the clavicle bone and the relative stability of the fixation of the medial fracture.

{"_id": "3271477-1", "title": "", "text": "A 24 year-old female, teacher by profession, with normal birth and developmental history, presented with a history of generalized tonic clonic seizures since three years and frequent episodes of bizarre posturing of limbs followed by unresponsiveness since one and half years.\nShe was well until three years back when she had the first episode of sudden loss of consciousness with repetitive tonic clonic movements of all four limbs and tongue bite. This was not associated with any prodrome, aura or any postictal automatisms or autonomic symptoms. The episodes were short lasting (usually about a minute) and not followed by any focal neurological deficit and the frequency being two to three episodes per month. There was no history of myoclonic jerks or any definite relation to sleep deprivation or menstrual cycle and no family history of seizures. MRI of Brain and a routine EEG done prior to coming to this hospital were normal. At some other hospital, based on a diagnosis of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, sodium valproate with a maximum total dose of 1250 mg/day and clobazam with dose of 20 mg/day, was started. As per the patient the seizure frequency had not changed significantly on treatment. She had gained weight and also developed menstrual irregularities on medications and hence she left all her medications nearly an year ago.\nNearly one and half years ago, she started to have episodes which were more prolonged with a gradual progression of symptoms. She would start having bizarre, flinging movements of all four limbs and neck, without tonic clonic movements, jaw clenching, tongue bite or incontinence. At the onset of the episode she would be partially responsive but would lapse into drowsiness over the next few minutes. These would be precipitated whenever she would delay her meals or miss meals but had no relation to exercise or movement. Also the mother used to feed her in this state of reduced responsiveness and over next few minutes she would gradually improve. There was history of amnesia for these episodes As a result the mother had started giving her meals every two to three hours and even wake her up at midnight to feed her. The duration of these would range from few minutes to about half an hour. She had also started feeling hungry more frequently and had gained weight in the last one year. During the same period she also continued to have generalized tonic clonic seizures.\nA provisional clinical diagnosis of generalized tonic clonic seizures, probably idiopathic generalized epilepsy with Non epileptic attacks, was made.\nShe was admitted for evaluation. On examination she was found to be obese. Rest of her general physical examination including the vitals revealed no abnormality. Examination of her nervous system including higher mental functions, cranial nerves, sensorimotor system and extrapyramidal system were all normal.\nThe patient was instructed to miss her meals and concomitant video-EEG monitoring was done.\nA typical attack was induced after 2 hours. Her extremities became cold and she started sweating profusely. She was confused but able to respond to questions. Almost simultaneously she started having involuntary, unpurposeful, non-rhythmic, asynchronous bizarre movements of her limbs, abnormal posturing, opisthotonous posturing, tongue darting, facial grimacing and limb thrashing. There were no tonic or clonic components. A random blood glucose level was done by finger prick method and was found to be 24 mg% (normal 55-100 mg%). She was infused intravenous dextrose and within a few minutes she regained consciousness and the movements subsided.\nRegular monitoring of her blood glucose revealed spontaneous asymptomatic hypoglycemia at several occasions per day (as low as 35 mg%), precipitated by fasting. However, the attacks occurred only when her blood sugar decreased to < 25 mg%.\nOne episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure with tongue bite, lasting for a minute was witnessed in the ward during the morning hours. A random blood sugar done at that time was 45 mg%.\nIn view of the abnormal movements being a combination of chorea, ballism and dystonia with prolonged duration, no temporal relation to movement or any form of startle, we diagnosed them as being Paroxysmal non-kinesiogenic dystonic choreoathetosis. As a possible etiology for symptomatic recurrent hypoglycemia and weight gain, Insulinoma was suspected. Serum fasting insulin levels were done and were found to be markedly elevated in the range of 106 IU/L (Normal lab values 2.6-24.9 IU/L). MRI of abdomen with contrast revealed a hypoechoic mass lesion in the distal pancreas, size 2 × 3 cm with no evidence of local or distant metastasis, possibly Insulinoma Figures and .\nEEG done during the episode showed intermittent sharp waves and spike and wave discharges in the period preceding the episodes. Blood sugar levels were also done simultaneously and the electrographic discharges were found to appear only during hypoglycemic periods and subside when normoglycemia was restored. Interictal EEG record, however, was normal.\nShe was given frequent small meals and was given intravenous dextrose only if she became symptomatic. She underwent a laparotomy and was found to have a 3 × 3 cm firm tumor in the postero-superior aspect of distal pancreas adherent to the splenic vein, without any distant metastasis. A distal pancreactectomy with splenectomy was performed.

{"_id": "3487218-1", "title": "", "text": "A 3-year-old symptomatic girl was diagnosed to have a large PDA, left to right (L-R) shunt, left atrial and left ventricular volume overload (LALVVO), and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Moderate MR was considered secondary to annular dilation from the marked LALVVO. On angiogram the PDA measured 6 mm at the pulmonary arterial end and 13 mm at the aortic ampulla. She underwent device closure of PDA using a 12 × 10 mm Cocoon duct occluder (Vascular Innovations Co., Thailand) using a standard technique.[] The pulmonary arterial pressure was documented to be less than 50% of the systemic pressure prior to device deployment. The final angiogram revealed a well-deployed device with a moderate (L-R) residual shunt []. The shunt was expected to resolve with progressive thrombus formation and the child was discharged on diuretics. At 6-month follow-up, echocardiogram revealed a significant (L-R) shunt persisting through the duct occluder, with LALVVO and moderate MR. Although there was no hemolysis, the child was symptomatic with exertional dyspnea and poor weight gain.\nDeployment of a coil inside the Cocoon duct occluder followed by deployment of an Amplatzer duct occluder (ADO II) adjacent to the Cocoon device successfully reduced the large shunt to a trivial one. Hemodynamic data revealed half-systemic pulmonary artery pressure. An aortogram done in lateral, right anterior oblique and anteroposterior view revealed good positioning of the previously implanted PDA device with no deformation or change in orientation. However, there was a large left to right shunt, with contrast flowing through the device as well as exiting superolaterally from around the body of the device. Endothelialization around the central part of the device was evident angiographically with at least 1 mm separation between the device and vascular lumen similar to the observation by Javois,[] suggesting that the device was secure. The tip of a 5F Judkin's right coronary artery (RCA) catheter was forced from the retrograde route into the device. The RCA catheter was exchanged for an M-Vert 5F catheter (Merit Medical Systems, South Jordan, USA) through which a 38-8-6 free embolization coil (Cook, Bloomington, USA) was deployed inside the previously deployed device []. As the shunt remained undiminished, it was decided to deliver two additional smaller Cook embolization coils (38-3-3) inside the device. Both these smaller coils, on delivery, migrated across the device into distal left pulmonary artery branches and being inaccessible were not retrieved.\nA lateral projection during delivery of both smaller coils confirmed that the catheter tip had not crossed the pulmonary end of the large PDA device. However, we presume that the delivery catheter tip may have been abutting the wall of the device with inadvertent delivery of the two small coils across the device into the space around the pulmonary end of the device. This was the evidence of the presence of a large space between the device and the wall of the PDA and the prime reason for persistence of the large residual shunt despite one large coil within the device [].\nOn observation over the next 48 hours, the shunt did not decrease and hence the child was catheterized again. The PDA occluder was again entered from the retrograde route with a 5Fr RCA catheter over a straight tip 035 Terumo wire. Persistent attempts to cross the device with the wire resulted in the wire exiting the body of the device into the ductal lumen superolaterally and from there into the main pulmonary artery (MPA) []. The wire entry point at the aortic disc of the device was balloon dilated with a 2 mm coronary balloon catheter over a 0.014” BMW PTCA guide wire (Abbott, Santaclara, USA). A 5Fr right coronary guiding catheter was then manipulated over the wire into the MPA. A 6 × 4 mm ADO II (AGA Medical Corporation, North Plymouth, USA) was then deployed through the guiding catheter with the distal disc at the pulmonary end, the middle cylindrical portion adjacent to the body of the Cocoon occluder and the proximal disc in the descending aorta, flush with the aortic disc of the Cocoon occluder []. Immediate post-procedure aortogram showed a significantly reduced shunt [], which further decreased to show only a restrictive trivial shunt by echocardiography 24 hours later []. Five months post-procedure, the child is reportedly asymptomatic with good weight gain and with no further episodes of respiratory tract infections. There was also no evidence of hemolysis after the second procedure.", "tokens": ["3", "year", "symptomatic", "girl", "diagnosed", "large", "pda", "left", "l", "r", "shunt", "left", "atrial", "left", "ventricular", "volume", "overload", "lalvvo", "moderate", "mitral", "regurgitation", "mr", "moderate", "mr", "considered", "secondary", "annular", "dilation", "marked", "lalvvo", "angiogram", "pda", "measured", "6", "mm", "pulmonary", "arterial", "end", "13", "mm", "aortic", "ampulla", "underwent", "device", "closure", "pda", "12", "10", "mm", "cocoon", "duct", "occluder", "vascular", "innovations", "thailand", "standard", "technique", "pulmonary", "arterial", "pressure", "documented", "50", "systemic", "pressure", "prior", "device", "deployment", "final", "angiogram", "revealed", "deployed", "device", "moderate", "l", "r", "residual", "shunt", "shunt", "expected", "resolve", "progressive", "thrombus", "formation", "child", "discharged", "diuretics", "6", "month", "follow", "echocardiogram", "revealed", "significant", "l", "r", "shunt", "persisting", "duct", "occluder", "lalvvo", "moderate", "mr", "hemolysis", "child", "symptomatic", "exertional", "dyspnea", "poor", "weight", "gain", "deployment", "coil", "inside", "cocoon", "duct", "occluder", "deployment", "amplatzer", "duct", "occluder", "ado", "ii", "adjacent", "cocoon", "device", "successfully", "reduced", "large", "shunt", "trivial", "hemodynamic", "data", "revealed", "half", "systemic", "pulmonary", "artery", "pressure", "aortogram", "lateral", "anterior", "oblique", "anteroposterior", "view", "revealed", "good", "positioning", "previously", "implanted", "pda", "device", "deformation", "change", "orientation", "large", "left", "shunt", "contrast", "flowing", "device", "exiting", "superolaterally", "body", "device", "endothelialization", "central", "part", "device", "evident", "angiographically", "1", "mm", "separation", "device", "vascular", "lumen", "similar", "observation", "javois", "suggesting", "device", "secure", "tip", "5f", "judkin", "s", "coronary", "artery", "rca", "catheter", "forced", "retrograde", "route", "device", "rca", "catheter", "exchanged", "m", "vert", "5f", "catheter", "merit", "medical", "systems", "south", "jordan", "usa", "38", "8", "6", "free", "embolization", "coil", "cook", "bloomington", "usa", "deployed", "inside", "previously", "deployed", "device", "shunt", "remained", "undiminished", "decided", "deliver", "additional", "smaller", "cook", "embolization", "coils", "38", "3", "3", "inside", "device", "smaller", "coils", "delivery", "migrated", "device", "distal", "left", "pulmonary", "artery", "branches", "inaccessible", "retrieved", "lateral", "projection", "delivery", "smaller", "coils", "confirmed", "catheter", "tip", "crossed", "pulmonary", "end", "large", "pda", "device", "presume", "delivery", "catheter", "tip", "abutting", "wall", "device", "inadvertent", "delivery", "small", "coils", "device", "space", "pulmonary", "end", "device", "evidence", "presence", "large", "space", "device", "wall", "pda", "prime", "reason", "persistence", "large", "residual", "shunt", "large", "coil", "device", "observation", "48", "hours", "shunt", "decrease", "child", "catheterized", "pda", "occluder", "entered", "retrograde", "route", "5fr", "rca", "catheter", "straight", "tip", "035", "terumo", "wire", "persistent", "attempts", "cross", "device", "wire", "resulted", "wire", "exiting", "body", "device", "ductal", "lumen", "superolaterally", "main", "pulmonary", "artery", "mpa", "wire", "entry", "point", "aortic", "disc", "device", "balloon", "dilated", "2", "mm", "coronary", "balloon", "catheter", "0", "014", "bmw", "ptca", "guide", "wire", "abbott", "santaclara", "usa", "5fr", "coronary", "guiding", "catheter", "manipulated", "wire", "mpa", "6", "4", "mm", "ado", "ii", "aga", "medical", "corporation", "north", "plymouth", "usa", "deployed", "guiding", "catheter", "distal", "disc", "pulmonary", "end", "middle", "cylindrical", "portion", "adjacent", "body", "cocoon", "occluder", "proximal", "disc", "descending", "aorta", "flush", "aortic", "disc", "cocoon", "occluder", "post", "procedure", "aortogram", "showed", "significantly", "reduced", "shunt", "decreased", "show", "restrictive", "trivial", "shunt", "echocardiography", "24", "hours", "months", "post", "procedure", "child", "reportedly", "asymptomatic", "good", "weight", "gain", "episodes", "respiratory", "tract", "infections", "evidence", "hemolysis", "procedure"]}

{"_id": "3861379-1", "title": "", "text": "A 33-year-old woman (married, homemaker) presented with frequent high-grade fever and left-sided abdominal pain that had lasted for 1 month. There was no history of cough, sputum, or any other respiratory symptoms. She had no history of diabetes, hypertension, TB, or other significant illness. Physical examination showed that her body temperature was 38℃, pulse rate 105 beats/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg. Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged and tender spleen. Routine examinations of other systems showed unremarkable findings. The patient's laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 11,590/mm3, hemoglobin concentration 9.4 g/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein concentration 9.02 mg/dL. Other biochemical parameters, including liver functions and levels of blood sugar, blood urea, and serum creatinine, were within normal limits. T-SPOT.TB assay (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) showed positive result and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the patient was seronegative for anti-HIV antibodies. Chest radiography revealed no remarkable abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed multiple low-density lesions of variable size, with some septations, in the spleen (). We also observed several enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, which showed central low attenuation with a peripheral rim enhancement, suggestive of TB lymphadenitis (). An ultrasound-guided splenic biopsy revealed inflammatory cells with focal necrosis, and results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and TB-polymerase chain reaction were negative. Laparoscopic biopsy of the small bowel mesentery was performed for differential diagnosis and to exclude malignancy. However, biopsy of abdominal lymph nodes could not be performed, because profuse bleeding was expected as a result of severe adhesion of small bowel mesentry. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of both acute and chronic inflammation without granuloma. Our initial impression, based on the clinical and radiological findings, was splenic TB accompanied with abdominal TB lymphadenitis. We initiated antituberculous chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. After 1 week of chemotherapy, the patient became afebrile and did not complain of abdominal pain. She was subsequently discharged.\nAfter 10 weeks of chemotherapy, the patient returned to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden-onset dull and aching pain in the abdominal upper left quadrant. Abdominal CT scan showed more increase in the size and number of splenic abscesses with intraperitoneal rupture (), whereas more decrease in the size and number of abdominal lymph nodes than were previously observed (). The patient did not report occurrence of recent trauma. The patient was admitted for emergency splenectomy. Gross findings included multiple yellow necrotic nodules and hemorrhagic foci with a lacerated splenic capsule (). Histopathological examination showed epithelioid granulomas composed of epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and Langerhans giant cells with variable degree of central caseous necrosis, consistent with TB (). AFB staining and culture for TB from the splenectomy specimen were negative. Considering the clinical improvement of the patient and radiological improvement of concomitant abdominal lymph nodes, we assumed that the splenic rupture was precipitated by paradoxical reaction.

Spirometry was done, which showed a moderate restrictive pattern.\nShe was treated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg) and pulse of cyclophosphamide (1 g/month) for 6 months, and then put on Cellcept for another 6 months, but ILD did not improve. Thus, the patient was treated with rituximab 2 g (1 gram every 14 days) and showed gradual improvement, then she was subsequently treated with 100 mg of azathioprine daily, prednisolone 5 mg bid, and calcium plus vitamin-D.

{"_id": "3989831-1", "title": "", "text": "A 3-year and 6-month-old male child presented to us with complaints of intermittent fever for 1 month. The parents complained of refusal for feeds and lethargy. He had a history of polydipsia and polyuria. Antenatal ultrasound scans had identified an absent right kidney with hydronephrosis of the left kidney. His parents had been advised surgery for left pelviureteric junction obstruction at the age of 2 months, but they had refused.\nAt presentation to us, the child had chronic renal failure with severe metabolic acidosis. A large renal lump was palpable in the left flank. Blood investigations revealed Hb of 6 gm%, total leukocyte count of 15,900/cumm, serum sodium of 116 mmol/L, serum potassium of 2.1 mmol/L, serum creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 97 mg/dL. Urine examination revealed pyuria with significant growth of Escherichia coli. Ultrasound of the kidney revealed absent right kidney with gross hydronephrosis and parenchymal thinning on the left side. Debris was noted in the dilated pelvicalyceal system.\nThe child was stabilized in pediatric intensive care for fluid and electrolyte imbalance and was administered culture specific antibiotics.\nThe DTPA scan revealed non-visualization of the right kidney with severely diminished parenchymal uptake on the left side without any excretion over 24 hours.\nAfter stabilization, he was taken for open left pyeloplasty. The kidney was grossly dilated with thinned-out parenchyma. The dilated pelvicalyceal system was full of an unusual, white creamy material with thin flakes, not resembling pus []. The system was also lined by the same material. The flakes were gently aspirated out and sent for culture and histopathology. Anderson-Hyne's dismembered pyeloplasty was performed with a nephrostomy tube. The post-operative course was uneventful. Hisopathology revealed focal areas of mature squamous epithelium with keratinization. The flakes were suggestive of an acellular keratin-forming membranous sheath [].\nAt a follow-up of 1 year, the child is asymptomatic with normal renal function.", "tokens": ["3", "year", "6", "month", "male", "child", "presented", "complaints", "intermittent", "fever", "1", "month", "parents", "complained", "refusal", "feeds", "lethargy", "history", "polydipsia", "polyuria", "antenatal", "ultrasound", "scans", "identified", "absent", "kidney", "hydronephrosis", "left", "kidney", "parents", "advised", "surgery", "left", "pelviureteric", "junction", "obstruction", "age", "2", "months", "refused", "presentation", "child", "chronic", "renal", "failure", "severe", "metabolic", "acidosis", "large", "renal", "lump", "palpable", "left", "flank", "blood", "investigations", "revealed", "hb", "6", "gm", "total", "leukocyte", "count", "15", "900", "cumm", "serum", "sodium", "116", "mmol", "l", "serum", "potassium", "2", "1", "mmol", "l", "serum", "creatinine", "2", "8", "mg", "dl", "blood", "urea", "nitrogen", "97", "mg", "dl", "urine", "examination", "revealed", "pyuria", "significant", "growth", "escherichia", "coli", "ultrasound", "kidney", "revealed", "absent", "kidney", "gross", "hydronephrosis", "parenchymal", "thinning", "left", "side", "debris", "noted", "dilated", "pelvicalyceal", "system", "child", "stabilized", "pediatric", "intensive", "care", "fluid", "electrolyte", "imbalance", "administered", "culture", "specific", "antibiotics", "dtpa", "scan", "revealed", "visualization", "kidney", "severely", "diminished", "parenchymal", "uptake", "left", "side", "excretion", "24", "hours", "stabilization", "open", "left", "pyeloplasty", "kidney", "grossly", "dilated", "thinned", "parenchyma", "dilated", "pelvicalyceal", "system", "full", "unusual", "white", "creamy", "material", "thin", "flakes", "resembling", "pus", "system", "lined", "material", "flakes", "gently", "aspirated", "culture", "histopathology", "anderson", "hyne", "s", "dismembered", "pyeloplasty", "performed", "nephrostomy", "tube", "post", "operative", "uneventful", "hisopathology", "revealed", "focal", "areas", "mature", "squamous", "epithelium", "keratinization", "flakes", "suggestive", "acellular", "keratin", "forming", "membranous", "sheath", "follow", "1", "year", "child", "asymptomatic", "normal", "renal", "function"]}
